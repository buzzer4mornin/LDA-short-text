The intent might be there, however it is not felt on the ground
There is so little interest or ability at higher levels in anything that is a day to day activity.   Since just finishing is the goal, even if this is also just background deliverables to the higher levels, it doesn't matter the suffering needed to get things done.  Additional micromanagement is not the answer, we have plenty of that.  A basic and direct in person understanding of the rules and procedures before making decisions would be an improvement.  Maybe then it would be understood that the default position of taking additional work and or accepting other areas padded timelines while accepting far more difficult ones internally is not always the answer.     There seems to an official or unofficial hierarchy of people expecting others to constantly fix their problems for them, apparently since they are incapable of doing their own work.
Our department is in a continual cycle of high level, bigger, better and expand the program and capabilities while the basics are in many cases forgotten about. The basics are the foundation of what we need to provide to our internal customers. The personnel we serve I believe are not being support enough to be totally successful.   Other groups we interact with and support are not open at all to our perspective. We are both on the same Merc/MSD but are called out by those who we interact with as driving up cost, causing delays and being obtrusive. If they would follow their own procedures in projects and incorporate the policies and procedures they have set for themselves and in many cases with the support and help from our group they would be more successful and the time, cost and overall success of project would be increased.
Escalations are typically effective, however the volume of barriers is high
A lot of work has been done, but still some process and interactions are too complex to deal.
I know Merck is a big company, but some of the guidelines that have to be followed inhibit some customer interaction and taking part in some activities that come very easily for competitors.
I look that many of steps are increasing year by year.
Overemphasis on redundant procedures.
I feel the department is trying to remove barriers, but we are fairly mired in it and not making much progress, likely due to resources being spread too thin to give it good focus.
We are still working in a culture of No.  Management says no before even considering new ways of working
we still have some place for improvement on avoiding duplicate tools/controls and removing bureauracy from some processes
As an oncology field sales representative the restrictions placed on the representatives regarding programs with HCPs, education limitations, exhibit support and number of meals with HCPs has significantly put us at a disadvantage to our competitors. I respect the cautious approach to field sales activities and support Merck’s ethical stance regarding HCP interactions, but the most recent restrictions placed in 1Q of 2021 (on top of COVID restrictions) are not reasonable and inhibit the ability for the sales representative to adequately perform.
Right now the company seems to be putting up barriers not removing them.
My department does not remove barriers to create efficiencies.   1.  My division has an aspiration to “become the leading oncology company,” however, my department does not allow me or anyone in our division to identify ourselves as Oncology Specialty Representatives or even mention the word “oncology.”  How can one become the leading oncology company without identifying oneself as affiliated with “Oncology.”  This is a barrier. 2.  We utilize applications like RXVantage to schedule lunches with customers.  My department does not allow the product name to be utilized.  The customer would be better served if they could associate me with the product and not just the indications I cover.  This is a barrier that slows down work.
We always work hard to streamline activities and cross training in other areas within our group so we have greater flexibility when 1 area is busier.
I recently moved to a new department, and have no observation on the department's ability to remove barriers that slow work down.
Our sales leadership tries to remove barriers, but there are many that hinder our work that they are unable to change.  Examples include: limits on number of RFMs per month (this limits access and time with customers since there are many on my team), limits on number of customers permitted to attend a virtual RFM (due to the RAT tool and customer restrictions we must conduct many of our RFMs virtually.  Many accounts have more than 25 people and therefore we cannot meet with these customers).  These are just a few examples of  barriers we have that are not consistent with industry standards (other companies do not have these restrictions)
We are in the process of implementing the QSIP topics which will enable more productivity in the future
Our department is very short staffed causing barriers to slow down the work.
barriers are not easy to remove, although our BU tries hard.
I think there are great initiatives, but they are getting lost along the way when 'real' priorities are set.
While doing our business the right way is critical -- we tend to build a higher road than others which leads to unlevel playing fields -- and confusion from our customers as we act differently than other pharma.
Still work to be done.   We talk about being customer centric and use the Aslan model, yet some of the direction is not customer focused.   However, we have more tools/programs today than in the past, but short sighted with customers experience, standard of expectation, tools for primary products.    Examples....changing the Bravecto rebate to no longer mix/match.  No Client education/information/posters/clinic materials for Sentinel Brands - what we do have is focused on Sentinel Spectrum ONLY....and that is limited to a great puppy kit and brochure that contains NO client education.
The rat tool is ruining my business
Product outages is a recurring event.
Cross-functional collaboration, create templates, challenge region on unnecessary tasks
My department has made significant progress on this over the past year
my manager calls for too many meetings and sends too many emails
There seems to be more “busy work” to do lately. We are told to remain focused on 1 particular product, but then we get fire drills to complete with other products.
MES is a huge barrier that does not seem to get the attention it deserves. Our production timeline has been prolonged, we have been forced to abort several batches because of MES issues, and we have more corrections than we did on paper batch sheets, which bog down the managers as well as the operators. I think there needs to be more assistance and visibility on this issue. We need help, and all we tend to get are more work-arounds. It is unacceptable that we are being forced to use a system that is not fit to our needs. Alum used to be a model area. MES is one of the biggest reasons why we didn't meet our production goals last year, why we continue to struggle, and are no longer deemed a model area.
Our work is not slow down
This can be difficult to maneuver at times due to global processes in place and areas not willing to ensure they have secured all departments input before making a change. our processes in some cases have slowed down work.
Even in the wake of the pandemic, work did not slow down. There was no defined assistance for working parents with school-aged children at home that helped in slowing the work down. Rather, it just got busier and expectations grew bigger.
I can't say as a company MSD do this well. if anything the company create the barriers. for the department, would like us to challenge all the risk assessments being completed and consolidate to one topic that covers all the needs.
We are a company that was acquired by Merck and it seems like when changes are made the communication change is lacking.  For example, we are currently in the process of changing the way that MSD and MAHI entities report intercompany sales.  We were not given the necessary training in order for this to be smooth process.  Also the communication when received used MSD jargon and acronyms that we were unfamiliar since we were purchases by Merck with therefore it made it hard to cypher out what was expected.
I have spent 3 years in Animal Health sales and to agree with this statement, but my previous 13 years in Human Health sales with Merck didn’t feel as speedy for change
The animal care department has a culture of praising those who turn others in, report when other employees are making mistakes, etc, it has created a competitive, stressful environment.  There is also rampant bullying which is left unchecked.  Employees, including leads, are allowed to single out individuals who they don't like and harass and bully them.  Not all employees are treated with the same level of scrutiny.
For example of price or pap, my department does a good job to help more patient can access
No, reps voices are not well received despite having the best knowledge in the field. Company invested in programme wanting to be aligned with advancing technologies but do not cater to the needs of a specified portion of population who required the programme assistance the most. Rep feedback was not even taken into consideration when action was made to digitalise  the whole programme.
We constantly hit the wall, when we try to be innovative and creative. It is not a good environment for new idees and doing things in a new way.

Walk the walk with being a flex workplace. It has been so disappointing to see the CLT's directive in December/January to mandate days in the office and stop flexible work arrangement requests after 10 months of employees performing their roles almost fully remotely.  It has really made me consider if I have a future working with MSD which I never thought I would say.
Give children of long term employees the opportunity to break into MSD.
Continue to evolve in the changing times and be more flexible and innovative
simplify process and impower people
Secure Employees that they will still have a job despite of the pandemic
Continuing to provide more flexible, more open environment, more opportunities and staff career development which can be more competency compare to competitor in the market
Maintain the welfare and safety of their employees as well continue to Inspire a positive corporate Culture with a healthy work environment.
I think some process need improvement, so it can take less time to resolve problems
Promotion should be determined based on competency.Admit challenge.This company seems too consevertive.
I feel any company is based on there research and sales force. Give them some liberty and take care field force should be more focused on sales. in our industry every work like admin as well as everything is been a burden on sales force.
Kindly specify what new pipeline coming in organisation
It would be great if the unnecessary steps that have been slowing us down can be removed from our daily work.
Transparency & politics free environment at work
Streamline and simplify where information resources are stored.
Oh my god... Just ask yourself, what should we do for the employees a three quarter years ago. And start proactively executing it. React on all the data you already have, and finally GO BEYOND your shadow to try to: * provide superior support for people at home (so we have the equipment (that's sitting unused in our buildings), and feel that company cares) * do whatever you can do to allow people to meet again (get someone COMPETENT who can think outside the box of regulations... It's not only about security measures, but about that teams need to meet. Creative teams need to work together. Are you solving that? Is there a strategy or plan that is being executed already? If not, it's too late and the company will suffer by poor results of such teams due to remote work.)
to be more inclusive and embrace diversity is not only the slogan but action. Hope the crtitical direction and big decision are not made by small group of people
Set priorities to remove stress as since working remotely, the work lead has largely increased. Dear to remove/delete projects which are nice to have but not needed to have.
I feel my role is very task orientated, and administrative heavy resulting in it being difficult to quantify what I actually 'do' every day.   Whilst there has been some considerations taking on board regarding working from home for the last year, I dont feel its went far enough. Flexibility is great but being able to avail of it when workload is high is a challenge.
Push harder in direction of breaking the silos and transparency around decision making
Empower Empower Empower - and I mean really empower and remove the unnecessary "approval needs"
I feel very strongly about Sustainability so the challenge is to get get all department mangers to make Sustainability a priority and have the resources and funding available to implement the changes necessary to improve all aspects of Sustainability across the network. There are so many changes that can be easily implemented to improve the sustainability of MSD.
- Harmonization of policies, procedures and standards between HH and GMSA (this will avoid duplicate work in markets) - increase human resources (especially in Compliance & Data Privacy)
Merck should be more clear on the path moving forward post Organon spin off
Hiring new people and promoting right people
Reduce the amount of meetings or clearly indicate on invite, if a meeting is mandatory or if it will be recorded / both global and local meetings
Reduce complexity of the organization and transfer responsibility to lower levels to improve efficiency and handling speed.
Be open to remote working; 2020 has proven that remote working is successful and people can still deliver great results
Improve work-life balance
Enable flexible working for all employees, not just those with a progressive line manager. Stop presenteeism culture. Be clearer about the companies future. I'm worried about they direction and future stability of our business, especially when Ken goes
Let us work from office again. Stop woke social experiments - non-US hubs/offices should not be a hostage of US cultural war.
Think about the work pressure, we keep getting fewer people in the department, the work load supporting a whole organization is huge. Please be advised that I have a wonderful job and manager but work load is getting bigger and bigger each day!
Listen to the needs from sales to do the best job towards customers instead of office based people making decisions not knowing about customers needs For office based colleagues to strive to give our customers the best experience with our products and support
Please make any company changes or adaption in the light of our customer not only for streamlining our processes or getting more and more efficient.
Rebalancing the number of changes that are being introduced at any single point in time.
Go CO2 neutral asap Have key product to cure COVID
MSD is an international company. MSD has offices everywhere. MSD should strive to adapt to the specific culture and mentality of each country.
Continue to leverage digital tools to enhance your decision making processes and to enable/free-up capacity. Additionally we should prioritize better and say no/not-now to new initiatives to pick up speed in execution of activities/projects/work
Continue to lead from the top by example. (Excellent leadership) We are all the team even the manager who has to be prepare to roll up sleeves during pressurised times to meet deadlines. Never let the team or teammate fail. Communication is vital
Continue to be innovative and caring
SIMPLIFY processes - we are slowed down in many projects because of heavy compliance processes - understand the need, but sometimes it's counterproductive and demotivating
I understand the goals and priorities within IT, but I feel that due to the many intricate dependencies, timelines are very aggressive and require 'cyber-response' levels of effort, at the expense of work/life balance. Seems that because we were able to band together for that common cause, that level of commitment is expected for every transformative initiative since.
More focus on the selection of middle managers and fight against nepotism. More emphasis on leadership behaviors and having the right values.
Continue the excellent benefits which allow flexibility and support during this challenging time (ex. childcare, healthcare, etc)
more transparency among different functional areas, encourage different opinions with actions not just words, provide more coaching
1.)Support Coaches when they ask for information or items (I'm getting ignored frequently). 2.) Have ONE repository for documentation at Wilson. Right now, I have 4 places where docs are stored and struggle to find what I need. SFRS is not user-friendly. 3.) Encourage team-building events, especially when exhibiting a high degree of flexibility right now.
Consolidate strategies and metrics to validate the real implementation and adoptions of WoW
Ensure the departments are aligned with the vision of Merck and MSD.
Continue to seek and hire a more diverse workforce, especially for the technical/science roles.
Publicly stating how we are committed to paying men and women equality for the same work, and providing data to support this claim.
For Merck to speak out about its shortcomings/failure.  It is no disgrace or shame. Not everything works out. If there is bad publicity in the news, bring it out and address it, don't hide from it. Address the issues.
Select knowledgeable and fear leaders
keep eliminating barriers to be a faster decision making company
More staff so I don't feel like I am working enough for 3 people
Give people responsibility and empower them. Stop doing micro-management on VP level or higher. Make sure that the workforce has the right level of resources or be brave enough to move/postpone things.
My group is more hierarchical and "rank-centric" than the US Army and Downton Abbey combined.  I believe this counter-WOW.
Training role out is slow, not yet felt on floor. Not enough leadership at floor level.
To make any work place great, all the working people should feel like family. If you think, employee is spending second most of his/her time in working environment and with colleagues after his/her own family. IF we want best from employee, he should feel home. I would recommend to build a culture at working place where all can feel home without being judged. I would recommend Merck & MSD to increase activities where colleagues can spend more time together where they can know each other and have those non work related conversations so people can understand each other more from where they are coming from, what culture, what country, what tradition. Activities like Happy Fridays, Bowling plans, more team lunches, once a year get to gather with family (within teams only), etc. I hope this helps to come together on socially and it helps to build relations which last long and make employee to work for same organizations longer due to knowingness of each other and family environment.
In future "return to work" activities, it will be important to recognize that some employees are capable of continuing a work from home schedule despite not being previously offered that opportunity.
Allow employees who are part of a bargaining unit to have flexible work arrangements as well as pursue more higher education opportunities or tuition reimbursement for bachelor's degree programs. Provide those in administrative assistant (team support) roles opportunities to participate in developing skills that would allow them to qualify for promotions for different skill sets within the company.
Focus on science and building a robust pipeline
Deliver the message that everyone counts in this company.  We are a team and every player on this team makes this business thrive.  Additionally, in this virtual environment leaders need to be cognizant that they truly have to go the extra mile to maintain a meaningful connection with their direct reports.  Currently there is little connection and true concern for one's well-being.
I think MSD is an innovative company that is always in the vanguard of investigation and also looking for ways to keep its employees well compensated
Improve the HR and Hiring process. It takes entirely too long to post jobs, interview, hire and train someone. With internal moves the person who gets promoted often has to stay in the old role for an extended time to help train due to lack of resources. Hire more people to help.
Remote opportunity in post pandemic future so employees can find affordable place to live and don't have to commute and have a more time after work to stay healthy, take care of family and manage the job related stress level.
Provide subsidized childcare.  Have the leadership come up with a clear return to work strategy for each site and communicate it -- right now we are all waiting to hear what will be happening.
There are several organizations where "aware" staff will not work because they know leadership is not good (corrosive).  Human Resources should ACTIVELY identify bad leadership (an algorithm to track staff turnover rates perhaps) and resolve the problem (training for that leader or remove that leader).  We cannot depend on team members to step forward to bring this to Merck/MSD attention, they will simply move to another job.  High middle management is frequently competing with each other for the next promotion.  This drives additional workload because work is done in their organizations to "outshine" the competition which draws resources away from value add/decision making activity.  The highly competitive atmosphere promoted at Merck means resources are not always focused on high value tasks.  Collaboration suffers.
When everyone returns to work, consider having the individual employees decide how many days they need to come into the office.
Allow for more reasonable WMA timelines that do NOT include weekends and holidays, but do include enough time to provide quality work.
Continue with excellent communication and collaboration
I am a people manager and the process to search and hire is very complicated and time consuming.  Highly qualified people are not attracted to processes that make it difficult to work for a company.  Workday is not intuitive and it has been very hard to navigate.   My time at Merck has been the best professional experience of my career.  But, Merck IT and the hiring processes that I have been a part of have not been positive.  If we have to following the processes set up by IT and HR then there should be dedicated help professionals to make the processes go faster.
Have a strong pipeline of products that would ensure job security for my hospital franchise
Now that we all have shown how well we work from home thanks to COVID-19, take more steps to make that ok permanently. Make people working from home or remotely feel just as important and valuable to the company as people who drive into the HQ offices each day. Agree we sometimes need to come together in one place, but make it special when everyone makes the effort to drive in.
I believe this is a wonderful company already. This really has been the best company I have worked for so far. I have really enjoyed working here. At the moment I cannot think of anything.
Keep offering great benefits to employees including medical, mental health, health incentives (LiveIT) and family/child care. It's such a blessing to work for a company that offers these.   Keep stance/speaking up/out against racial injustice and politics and working towards a more inclusive culture.   Allow for a flexible/hybrid option for working from home once the pandemic is over. Working from home has been really beneficial for me and my family.
I’ve noticed a trend regarding upward mobility and new opportunities in careers at MAH Canada.  The system seems favour people who live in Quebec and are bilingual.  This does not always feel inclusive for candidates outside of this region given that a very small percentage of our clients are bilingual/residing in QC.  I realize this is where the HO is located, however given today’s virtual climate the best candidate should receive the job regardless of age, gender, race, and location/mobility to move.
Re-evaluate- and be willing to change- processes that are cumbersome, don't work and slow down progress. SIP is an example. So many of our sites, for whom we wish to be 'sponsor of choice', are bailing on Merck as 'forcing this very non-user friendly' platform on them.  Merck needs to be OK saying "we made a mistake' to our sites, and come up with alternatives until SIP works!
Continue to stress the importance of work-life balance and demonstrate this by manager example.  For example, limiting emails on weekends and encouraging others to take personal time.
Continue to explore new ways of working and embrace remote working so people do not have to be limited by where they live
In order to change the culture, I think it is important for leadership to be examples.  I do think that individuals new to the Merck have a different view of a large company and haven't figured out how to navigate organizations and connect to the central mission. One factor that makes it a great place to work is a sense of belonging.
I wish Our Chairman and CEO was not a Racist
I have seen Merck change in good ways &not such good ways the past 30 years. now as a sales person i have WAY too much on my plate -lots of new apps/technology w/poor training and high expectations to use them. Vaccines is complex &that i enjoy but territories are too large and all the applications we must employ from MMA to outlook to VIQ to QLIK etc is mind boggling. we need laptops /monitors . My sight, back and neck have been affected ...empower people, give us useful tools, level the playing field & get out of our way and allow us do our jobs. Also make growth the reward and get rid of PPO. It is beyond ridiculous to be measured by PPO.  Those are the cons. Positives - Great manager, i felt very safe during pandemic and cared for,and of course appreciated being paid and the very generous 100% PPO for 1S 2020.  Some of the new tools are nice like OCMS and remote FFMs. Appreciate that others may benefit from remote gigs and remote jobs that used to require HQ relocation as well.
Keep working on removing barriers between internal departments and foster transparency and collaboration
We need to work on our ruthless prioritization - Our ruthless prioritization needs to start at the top. Show the organization how the leaders are being deliberate and that will encourage/enable the organization below to follow suit. Another element is leadership competency - I see both the MPS capability and Leaders that inspire are two that we can begin to work on immediately. I still find that many leaders in the organization may be placed in their roles not because they do a great job in inspiring or enabling their teams for success but because of the knowledge they may have.  In many respects, it feels like at Merck talk the talk but do not walk the walk. We say we care about our people but our actions don't consistently reflect that nor are we always leading by example.
Facilitate transparency not only within the department but also between different sites especially for a global product. Quality of the product and timelines depend on it.
I think we could work on increasing transparency across programs and departments. It is significantly worse at Merck compared to similar companies I've worked at.
Transparency on strategy for product development and portfolio. Post Covid, what to expect for the return to office format, etc.
We need to simplify how we get things done in our company.
We have to make sure that our processes are more streamlined, less complicated, while keeping our integrity and ethical standpoint. Balance resources carefully to avoid overload for a longer period of time.
Keep listening to their employees feedback and actioning based on it, assuring employees wellbeing over all, while many Countries keeps on dealing with Pandemia challenges and additional stress.
Continue to seek appropriate balance as we engage customers to take healthy/appropriate risk (at times, it feels as we are so risk averse that we don't take action in places where our engagement would support our public health mission while also ensuring 100% ethical behavior.
1. Appropriately resources 2. Updated processes and ways of working  3. Revitalize PRT process  4. Allow for better virtual working by creating tools meant for virtual work environments 5. Trust employees by creating processes that empower employees
Be willing to take a risk on new technologies and opportunities, we can't continue to be successful by being conservative and letting other competitors take the lead.
I’m most concerned about the company requiring employee agreement with the tenants of Critical Social Theory in excessive Diversity and Inclusion initiatives.  Some of these tenants are inconsistent with my religious beliefs and practices.  Employees whose religious beliefs are firmly rooted in a traditional Judeo-Christian ethic are feeling unsafe in this progressive political-social environment.  We just want to do our jobs without feeling harassed by controversial and non-scientific social theories.  Please do not require all employees to agree with or support tenants that contradict our deeply held religious beliefs and practices.
Getting back to normal...pre-Covid
Put ideas into action.  Make diversity and inclusion part of our culture and not the latest hot topic.  Encourage people managers to invest more in their people and developing talent that can move more freely laterally and upwards if they are an ideal candidate.  We need to be more open minded about the ideal candidates who fit the former mold for different role types.
I can't think of a thing.  I love working at Merck.
Be transparent and fair with employees for the upcoming LOE with Januvia
Once the sites open, employees should have the option to continue to work remotely.
Let the work space stay at home for at least 3/4 days a week
Continue to listen to and value the input of it's employees.
Increase basic science training resources
Strive to ensure employees have the most current and up-to-date technology to complete the Book of Business efficiently.  Continue to focus on the safety of the employees and offer benefits to ensure they have options to manage and maintain life/work balance. Continue to focus on unmet medical needs and provide transparency to employees.
Take into consideration all we've learned during the Pandemic. We wasted so much time and money on unnecessary  travel. We need to look closer at what meetings can be done virtual vs in person.
Increase speed to make decisions, remove all  the layers, and be clear on who has the decision rights.
Continue with the survey's and focusing on the employee as well as the science
Empower employees to make responsible choices.
Nothing they are doing a good job on hiring a diverse workforce and it's a great place to work.
Let plants manage their own headcount. Let local leadership make better decisions on whether we can commit people to "extra" projects that we don't have time for. Give us more MPS support. There's no follow up for sustaining improvements. We need more people and resources. It's too stressful all the time.
I think we should communicate how this data is being used to influence change.  Leaders should continue to role model flex for success, and share how they are creating balance in their lives.  We should remove barriers to personal development, role modeling time taken to learn new skills. Continue emphasis on being people first More generous vacation time
Keep hiring great people, although we should expand the places that we look for candidates to increase diversity within the candidate pool.  Train and encourage folks to focus on the key experiments/business activities that drive results.  Have the courage to discontinue efforts that aren't promising.  Have the courage to start new ones and drive to Go/NoGo results quickly.
Why shouldn't all employees be in Company employee development program?   So the fact that only a select few are, makes me skeptical of my future opportunities at the Company.
Use more common sense when it comes to rolling out new quality procedures. One update can create massive ripple effects.
Reduce internal red tape - particularly when our competitors are not bound by the same stringency
Continue with transparency and being supportive of employees with information, recognition and rewards.
Elevate salaries to top tier of Pharma.
To keep on working hard on builiding an inclusive environment. We have been walking thru the diversity but a lot of work to be done in terms of inclusiveness
Clarity on priorities and increased awareness to the current external racial tensions
1.  Allow for new job field sales titles and  expand S3 for vaccines.  This change would demonstrate tenure and long term customer relationship capital is valued.   2.  Re-evaluate fair market compensation by job roles.  Each field sales role is unique.  (Ex. Hospital, Chronic, Oncology, HIV, Vaccines, etc.).  Skills for each job role may assist with providing adequate benchmarks for compensation.  (Ex. contracting, buy/bill, HIT, quality, stakeholders, variety of customer types, etc.) 3.  PPO payout at territory level for vaccines.  Individual PPO for vaccines allows for the more indivisible accountability.  Other peer vaccine company's do evaluate their team on an individual productivity.  Other Merck sales teams use individual PPO to evaluate their teams.  Including territory managers with PPO responsibility similar to CTLs and DCOs allows for more equity in the  SIP program.
Keep focusing in our work/personal life balance, providing technical and soft-skills training to improve our skills,
Utilize system, don't make additional deck and individual files. Too many PPT should be prepared for every tasks. For example, we have to prepare deck for talent review even though having WorkDay. These kind of duplicated job to fit individual needs really makes inefficiency and overload. Leading company has been trying to remove burdensome and inefficiency from daily working to focus on the important matters.
-Work life balance is key thing to improve.  -Reduce processes and clear direction from upper level --rather than managing at local leval.  -Retain talent people  -Creating supporting & collaborating environment in every level.
Make effort to listen into employee perspective instead of finger pointing and/or jumping into conclusion. Gap between upper and lower management can be improved by having a transparent open discussion, sharing of information and inclusion.
Provide clear direction and engagement. Hire the right leaders and groom the potential ones.
invest in their employee's, try to keep procdures simple but effective.
The company needs to stay as great an employer as it is now.  The ability to work from home or from the office at the employee's request.
Make sure that the tools that we use are fit for purpose (clear and efficient work processes). Now systems are created by very good IT people and do not really fit the job. A tool is successful when the users think it is (and not the creators or managers).  Further more we need global tools that do not yet exist. We need a quality maintenance tool for all periodic qualification/validation/assessment activities. It should show the actual quality status of a system/dept/plant/division with a push on a button. Compare it with SAP but then for quality. It is stupid that all sites have to think of a proper quality oversight system for them selves and many many colleagues are spending too much time updating lists and generating and checking overviews.
Remain focused on the vision, continue to be Agile and have iterative approach on people, processes and products.  Continue to build and outside-in approach for both external and internal customers (even if it 'sounds' oxymoron for the latter!) Stay relevant and show it !
outside of work team activities
Keep focusing on patient-centric culture, people development, diversity, and inclusion
Stop activities that take away employee sense of belonging and ownership.  For example, the open concept office areas where employees do not have a desk to call their own and put a photo of their family down upon.  We spend the best pat of our lives pouring the best of ourselves into our work at Merck.  Why insult us with petty office space policies?  Also, spend some resources on improving the interior of the buildings in which we work.  We seem to do a good job with landscaping to give the exterior of our site good curb appeal, meanwhile a lot of the interiors of our buildings a worn and run down looking.  Feeling good about our work environment is a morale booster and will probably make people more energized and productive.
I think that this is a great place to work and take pride in what I have accomplished.
Maintaining employee retention must be a priority, as expertise and knowledge is lost.
Regarding people: allow people to grow (in depth) within their roles while staying in same department and become an expert in that role (e.g. not every one in a group in job level P2, but also create sometimes a P3 position, and one that not directly is a managing job). Value knowledge. The definition of a successful career is not the same for every one, for one it is becoming a higher manager, while for the other it is gaining more in depth or diverse knowledge on a scientific or other level. This will increase diversity of people within groups and prevent some good experts to be 'forced' in managing roles. Thanks for reading!
Great place to work: uniformity / standardization regarding work expectations amongst managers.  There seems to be much diversity around what is expected of us during these times amongst managers.
Continue offering strong well studied products. Support the sales team as they are the boots in the field and support the relationships they have with customers.
Be willing to innovate and to listen to those who have valid experiences from outside of Merck.  Allow for meeting free day or morning / afternoon to allow employees to catch up on work and reflect on improvements that could be made or focus on professional development without having to constantly work evenings.
Need to continue to ensure the high stress roles (those supporting Operations and Release) are well staffed and supported.  As supply demands increase so does the work in these areas and if the goal is to reduce overall lead times we need to ensure these roles are supported - meaning we have the right digital solutions in place to easily and efficiently do our job or in some cases ensure proper staffing models so we can work on continuous improvement initiatives to make the work more streamlined and efficient.  It's often difficult to support run the business core work and continuous improvement work at the same time.
There is a lot of pushback on improvement ideas in the laboratory. The business is great at adapting to new ideas pertaining data integrity and moving to electronic processes for the lab, but the team is hesitant to implement changes to the training program that could result in a more developed and capable team because it is not how they have historically trained people.
There is a serious need to align our portfolio with our resources (financial and human) or deliberately modify expectations on quality of deliverables.  Across all areas of the organization.
We need to look at ways to course correct the current way of working to improve work life balance. In item 17, the meeting load coupled with "normal" requirements and aggressive program pace is hard to continue sustaining. Could there be a day or blocks of time for company meeting blackouts to free up time during the work day to complete work during normal business hours.
Focus on making processes simpler
Within the past 9 years, company headquarter was changed from Whitehouse to Kenilworth and now to Rahway.  This is just too much and causing confusion.  It also has financial impact which can be used to award people or to improve facility.  Flex center is one of the examples that we should put more efforts to bring in new technologies.
I feel Merck and MSD are doing the right things to put us in a strategic position in the marketplace. We are taking risks in our portfolio and starting to diversify our therapeutic expertise. Merck and MSD should continue to be focused on putting patients first and following science. I also appreciate Merck and MSD's stance on geopolitical issues as well as the environment. It is great to work for a company that embraces an evolving world and being at the front of it.
Please continue the push towards a more inclusive and diverse workforce. There is still so much to do because many people are totally unaware of the importance of this effort, unfortunately
Continue to focus on work/life balance and provide teams the flexibility and resources to manage stress
Company is doing a great job for work-life balance, still there are opportunities for improvement.  Company can focus more on expediting drug discoveries and fast deliveries
Keep continuing the good work to save humans.
Improve systems to allow more automated areas and reduce human error and checking. Compile systems to reduce admin work. Allow more flexibility in working time/place following global standard, not local culture.
Understand the challenges faced by our employees, both at work & in our personal lives dealing with the pandemic & recognize the commitment .
Focus Customer's need
*influence government decisions to allow working remotely within any EU countries during the pandemic, for those employees who do the job fully remotely.    *improve compensation packages
decrease number of bureaucratic barriers that dont help focusing on the actual job
Continue investing in MerckMSD people/employees :-)
All is great and very fortunate to work at Merck!
-Break down Divisional and Cross Divisional SIlos.  Require collaboration and driving toward the same "goal post".  We need to stop allowing/enabling the "opting out" and pursing personal agendas. -As we have seen this year, we need to make timely, informed decisions on our pipeline and focus resources on programs that will meet our goals and objectives.  Resources are lean and we need to focus on those programs that will drive us ahead. -Separate from Organon as expediently as possible.  Organon is a necessary distraction and we need to get this behind us and move on.
Keep doing what you have been doing. I've never felt more valued.  The handling of COVID and how it affected our jobs and personal life's was and is handled so AMAZING! THANK YOU MERCK!
While being an employee at Merck i have heard the phrase 'you do not know how things work here' spoken seriously and as a jest. While there is a feeling of inclusion on a personal level with other employees, when it comes to work related communication and relationships, people with different backgrounds, or simply people who have not been with Merck for the majority of their career, are viewed differently and some times even treated differently. The aforementioned phrase should not be spoken either in jest or seriously and i sincerely hope that steps will be taken to help employees change this view of their workplace.
Keep demonstrating that you value employees with the wide range of benefits you offer.  Keep prioritizing products that make the largest impact on public health.
diversity and allowing more opportunity for mobility
More communincations between employees especially about the vision of the company
Nothing
Come up with new alternatives to safe patients life. By doing this as employers we will also feel committed to deliver for a better cause.
Simplify the procedures
Launch New Products in India, Expand the Vaccines team for co-promotion along with CVM BU. Better Treatment of Field force, Making Support function i.e. Marketing, Admin accountable on deliverables. Focus on Adaptability to local markets. Launch Innovative HCP engagement programs
Thanks for asking this question, during this pandemic every one should be assured for job security
Be more equitable in where and how our innovative products go - which countries, etc. In other multinationals, the sense of being a global company is much stronger.
More trainings for future leaders
Give the people who already work for MSD more changes en opportunities, not just for the people who are new in the company. For instance when someone is new in the company a higher salary is easily given because we want that person to choose for us. But there are also people who's work changes / more responsibilities, other intern job. Then very often the conditions stay the same and that is not fair.
Having a proactive approach and less reactive approach ( following market trends, data) in what concerning adapting Practices and polices. being bold in taken different decision before competitors or market, similar to share bold expectation and aspirations
Not alienate white people. As a white person I feel unwelcome in my subsidiary. All I want is to work in a non-racial environment where I feel welcome and valued for my contribution, and where nobody's race and ethnicity is more important than the job at hand and the company's mission.
My current organization is in complete disarray. Most of the leaders left the company last year and it feels like the organization vanished.
Even more prioritization and alignment at the EC level to reduce workload
Less admin tasks, fewer support functions, mor focus and resources directed at customer interaction
Simplify processes.
I do not want to answer this question. Just please treat the employees as humans and not only as FTE cost/benefit numbers in statistics.
Real innovation with digital transformation, be less HQ-centric, develop cross-functional collaboration, and reconnect management with people working on the field (project, operations...)
Continue growing as they are and continue the positive attitude towards all ventures as they are currently doing - also maintaining the enthusiasm which they send out to internal as well as external customers.  It is great!
More transparency on company strategy for the future of our site. Lots of uncertainty right now. Would be nice if there was a clearer plan for the site to put everyone's mind at ease about the future.
Work to retain job roles
support compatibility of family and career (flexible work models, home office, women in leadership positions even in part-time etc.)
Connect people from different teams, C level to juniors and listen to their voice. Entire Leadership team sits in US only, therefore I do not find enough diverse perspective, decision is made there. I don't feel empowered enough to innovate nor cooperate with other teams, miss shared priorities and transparency.
Stay out of politics.
Eliminate redundancies and non-value-add workstreams.  Solutions to existing and ongoing problems often add their own layers of complexities.  In addressing one problem, the solutions create another.
Recognize contributions of employees. Provide easier path to promotion for individuals who have been fulfilling and excelling in roles at a higher level than they are currently compensated at for extended periods of time.
Allow folks to continue working from home indefinitely to promote maximum work life balance, particularly for those with disabilites and other unique challenges
Overall Merck is an excellent place to work and I am proud to be a sales representative for this company.  I also appreciated the $1000 grant as an incentive and owner of Merck  that was given all employees 3 years ago. This gift did remind me that Stock Options were part of the compensation package at the Sales level a number of years ago.  One suggestion I have  especially now that the company and sales force is significantly smaller is to include Stock options  again as part of the compensation package for representatives that exceed plan. I think this would be a great way to continue to motivate the Sales Force to think like an owner and provide  additional incentive  for employees who have chosen to stay in sales.
Continue to support employees and provide flexible work arrangements.
Focus on Science/Deliverables.
Merck is still very wary of funding and moving forward on projects that involve any type of innovation. Within our teams, we have been trying so hard to instill a culture of  embracing innovation especially automation but the support we receive from our leaders  has been minimal.   Additionally, I think Merck has a glut of talent with no opportunities to move forward in their careers. The serious lack of promotion opportunities, makes Merck a frustrating place to work at.
I think the connection between mission and financial realities (esp. bottom line) are abstract concepts to everyone, so  connecting the dots or messaging is helpful to keep employees engaged and committed.
continue to  evaluate ways to better work together and support one another.  continue to evolve benefits to stay ahead of industry standards and make Merck one above the rest
I wouldnt change anything. Merck is handling this difficult time extremely well.
Acknowledge the actual achievements and promote based on them rather than encourage people to switch to other groups/departments to get a "promotion"
Increase Digital transformation
Measure/gauge stress levels of people better. Seems to be a lack of awareness of personal stress at this time. A stop for a minute and just talk approach would be a good example.
Resources are overly concentrated on commercial planning, where many are only implementing what has been done for years. Innovation needs resources and empowerment to give other functions legitimacy to lead the way. For instance, policy and access need to be ahead of commercial launch so the market is ready when we arrive, but oftentimes, their value is measured by how they can help marketing this year, if not this quarter. It defeats the purpose.
The same bennefits that are given only to womans, should be given to man too. Because as an inclusive company, we must have the same rights (equality).
Help enable employees to map out a long term career plan
Ensure work life balance for the employees .
Keeping up the Good Work, And all ways put Our Mission Frist.
Have clearer plans when it comes to adopting a growth mindset.
Continue to connect groups. Avoid duplicating efforts. Evaluate actual process and continue to promote working from silos to networks.
Nothing to change really. Keep up the great work!
During this Pandemic ensure it is safe to return to the office and not being rushed because employees are depressed being home.  Safety before Comfort!  All Divisions should apply policies across the board for all levels when it comes to working from home.  This Pandemic proved or forced some Leaders to see it can be done at the lower Band Levels with success!
Empower people.
Continue to look for ways to work more efficiently.  Simplify processes.
Major changes to the Information Technology support for employees, generally and in conjunction, for example, with external Apps needed to perform business critical functions.  The Software Center lack of managing version changes to supported software creates a nightmare of resubmissions for approval and access.  In addition, it would be nice to have some Merck resources in IT, not just consultants.  It leads to more buy-in and better protection of intellectual property and assets. Also, we need way more Administrative support, since you're paying employees a ton of money to perform very simple tasks that take time, such as requesting a PO, etc. In addition, I would generally like to be able to call my HR representative, not do everything electronically.  So much less efficient for the employee. We have put too much responsibility on the employee to do practically everything, by making it easier for the departments who should be supporting them (IT, HR, Procurement, etc.).
We are not changing at the speed our competitors do. Why don't we create a working group to re-check all the steps from compliance to legal, from Patients Support program up to educational programs, from virtual meetings and digital engagement to clinical studies or pre-licensing, with a unique purpose of accelerating the change and simplify the internal processes.
talent retention strategy- need to understand why people are moving on to either different roles or outside of the company.
improve and unify systems/ tools for each role. I feel we have many different systems to gather information and it makes it difficult to collect the data and status , it would be important and efficient to a one side / system / tool to facilitate analysis and extract conclusions in order to prioritize accordingly
Keep morale high. Give your good managers support with removing bad employees who are bringing a department down. The direction of a company starts at the floor level. Empower your managers to do their job.
Hybrid work schedule to include both remote and in office.
Adopting some of the work flexibility we embraced during the pandemic to accommodate the very uncertain future ahead of us.
Avoid leadership imposing unilateral requirements to adopt/utilize a specific resource that is not pressure tested and solving a program that did not exist (ie. Veeva Engage).
Consider overhaul of IT infrastructure across all departments to align with modern computing capabilities.  Address concerns about being able to continue a WFH or more flexible work arrangements for office/lab/manufacturing based employees post COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.
Management at times becomes focused in one area. It is with great sadness that sexism is alive and well.
1.) The messaging at the top seems clear as far as our corporate strategy is concerned, but somewhere between the top and the bottom it feels like things are getting lost.  2.) Sometimes, I think we are overly conservative in areas that don't add value. For us to succeed long term I think we pragmatic and compliant solutions.
promote teamwork, promote not pointing out anyone for any reason, promote support between different roles. To grant positions to people who are really prepared for them, and not because they are friends os who is giving the position.
More realistic workload assigned to CRMs, considering the level of detailed the CRM is requested to be  aware of as well as responsible for.   Validations: workload of this activity  should also be taken into consideration.   Additionally support from HQ´s ASM /IMP / lab vendors to release shipments on timely manner to the countries as per plan. Its very frustrating pushing everybody to give SR and then ASM department does not release shipments on time and SR is delayed.    More competitive salaries.  Reduce micromanagement.   Have more transparent CTAC process and avoid inviting countries to validate studies that have low probabilities to be allocated to.
Too many meetings are scheduled and with the new work environment, it can be very stressful.  No meeting Mondays and/or Fridays would be helpful but needs to be reinforced from upper management.  Or another solution is requiring meetings to start at 15 after the hour.  This would be valuable because meetings won’t end at quarter of if you make them 45 minutes.  So what I mean is 11:15 - 12:00.  Gives 15 minutes to regroup from one meeting to the next.  But again needs to come from the top.
Invest in Chronic Care sales team for a strong future with product access, competitive and novel products.  Our division holds hard working, talented sales professionals who are willing to do what it takes to support customers and patients and keep our company thriving.
Allowance for electricity
Introduce time management e-learnings as mandatory in line with i.e. ergonomics at the work station
Focus on basics and stop making processes more complicated
Act more talk less. Focus on execution, I see many times how teams are so poor in executing their ideas.
MSD is a great place to work already, oncology pipeline should be enhanced further.
SEMPRE PROCURAR IMPLEMENTAR E OU MANTER BENEFICIOS AO EMPREGADO.
We need quality personnel in operations, the contractor experiment, always training people, and once we have people trained up, they are either hired, and moved to a different building/department/shift, etc.  Then we have to start training all over again.
I think MSD has the values and inspiration to make it a great place to work. Our managers are consistently keeping in touch at all levels in the company to see how we are feeing and getting on. This is not micro management but it gives a feeling of been valued that your state of wellbeing is been recognised and what you do matters. Managers can appear in any area and have a conversation with anyone they meet not just other manager. This gives us a sense of belonging and welcomed.
Help managers to engage directly with their direct reports, to guide their development and work. Help the whole organisation, especially managers, appreciate that engagement with direct reports is not a box ticking exercise. Also, develop processes that recognise the various needs of clients and help MSD teams support the clients compliantly BUT with the client in the centre.
building teams laterally and vertically with clear leadership roles and dynamic communications
please make information readily available without having to dig and search in multiple locations.  There is SO much for us to manage that it is hard to have it located in multiple places.  Keep all links accurate and active and organized.    Please consider allowing field folks to commute without having to move to new locations.  Having been remote for so long and having much of our jobs remain remote, many of us no longer want to move for our work and would prefer to telecommute and travel when needed.  Staying in our real homes rather than moving to new ones is a critical element of mental health these days, and likely will be for the foreseeable future.
More training
With the challenges we face today, it is important to be agile. I hope that the different procedures within MSD also adapt to this new reality. The distance between the medical department and the sales department sometimes becomes too big. This creates the feeling that your colleague is working for another company.
continuously support the remote working environment. This has been a blessing to be able to work from home, contribute to work, and have a balance in my personal life that I have never had before as result of my commute times.
I feel our drive for D&I is important to keep moving forward and make it mean something.  I also feel the leadership needs to develop obtainable transformation goals that are fundamentally correct so we do not have each new leader creating new direction.  People will change and each new leadership change seems to bring with it a new Revolutionary idea.  Seems like churn, in the end I can't say these changes have benefitted Merck.
strong pipeline and more diversity at the leadership level.
Work with GD&I to increase awareness of the ways of working and partner with Best Buddies to open jobs to those with intellectual disabilities.
Merck can be pennywise and pound foolish.  The systems in place roll out *often* causing changes in business practices.  In addition, several software suites that would make my job as a project manager/project engineer are not available from our IT department (I'm thinking things like Bluebeam Revu).  While $400 is not cheap for a software package, the time lost by me attempting to do work with inferior products (Adobe Acrobat DC, Powerpoint, or MS Visio) would pay for the upgrade several times over.  Additionally, Merck's involvement in national politics is ill advised in my opinion.  The GA election law changes are not something that is in Merck's mission and the company should be silent on the topic.  As a shareholder and employee, I don't think Social Justice goals shouldn't necessarily be on the top of Merck's agenda. We (as a company) should stick to our Mission: To discover, develop and provide innovative products and services that save and improve lives around the world.
Welcome and accept to localized decision making by Global/Regional, Appreciate on market intelligence and market difference... Trust between Global/Regional and Local Simplify unnecessary procedures Well-planned communication on new SOP/guidance before execution (rather than share after effective date)
more resources required to give a better customer service experience particularly around Direct by MSD. We need more resources in the CS team to cope with demand from customers, we need more specialist resource in the COBU teams to support the various systems and processes to ensure these are completed in a timely manner to ensure customer satisfaction when problems arise. We need better communication processes with our customers when there are issues
Could improve on the tools supplied to do the job. Phones and vehicles  Vehicles do not only need to be safe but should also be comfortable and have accessories to increase comfort. On road sales people spend long hours in these vehicles and are essentially our office
I am concerned that depts. without lab based employees are going to be ENTIRELY remote indefinitely.  I understand that there is an opportunity to give employees increased flexibility in work arrangements and covid has shown that we can work remotely much more than in the past.  This is good.  But I would not be happy working entirely from home without ever seeing my team members.  There are gains in efficiency and productivity that will be lost if we don't begin reconvening in the office together at regularly cadenced intervals once it is safe to do so.  It is not enough to offer employees a touch down space on site, if there are no other employees from their dept. on site at the same time.  A plan must be developed to regain the benefits of being on site again regularly, while also offering employees the advantages of more flexible work arrangements which covid has proven can be successful.
I think there is a huge opportunity for rotational program that would provide talented employees a development opportunity to learn more parts of the business.  I feel it is critical that our leaders have the understanding of the pressures, demands and processes other departments face (operations, finance, legal, procurement, marketing, sales).  This does not mean that each person needs to be an expert, but having a sense of awareness not only will result in greater efficiencies but it will also bring a greater compassion and understanding for the "why" behind decisions.
It has been said that nothing gets rid of a good employee faster than tolerating a bad one.  There are no rewards for a job well done, and no punishments for a poorly done job.  The prevailing believe at this site is that fair means the same thing as equal.  How much can someone be incentivized to do a great job year after year when you know that you can only get top marks in your year end evaluation once every three years?  All you have to do is wait for your turn.
Keep working to treat every site as a one Merck, making accesible equal opportunities to all of them.
Continue to encourage all management to be approachable and open to input and ideas from team members in a way that empowers them to speak up and contribute
Spend time to listen to employees in a personal conversation rather than through surveys.
leadership team always mention about work life balance  but we still have receiving a lot of meeting, emails, a lack of planning of the activities.
Have a better incentive program that is more actively used by management along with tangible rewards for meeting production goals instead of just pressing ahead to the next goal without celebrating our achievements.
Foster innovation and open culture for speak up
A lot of time is spent in administrative tasks that are needed daily. (e.g. Dealing with overseas teams who do accounting it is extremely time consuming).   All this very time consuming tasks do not allow to focus on projects that make the role more exciting.  It gets overwhelming to try to deal with a very high workload and high expectations when so much time is spent on admin tasks.   Effective systems that actually work and cut the time a task takes time is required. We are constantly introduced to new tools that do not seem to help, but rather make the job more complicated. When you finally get used to the tool is time for a new one.  More human resource is required many roles were eliminated from the past and the workload of the people who stayed behind just increases constantly with no end in sight.   Acknowledging that the work loads are high  is not enough measurements have to be taken so that there is change as this does not contribute to a good work-life balance.
Not just listen to our voices but also take serious considerations and actions!
In the last 1 year, the company has changed a lot, I understand that change is only constant but since the new MD joined people have started leaving the company because of the issue with MD on ways of working. The MD is started hiring people from his last organization on all head positions and now these new heads are really putting pressure on people and forcing them to work more than 12 hours and day. The new heads are humiliating people and not recognizing their effoerts. The current environment in the company is very toxic and it's scary to work in MSD now, you never know when your department may be changed and when you will be kicked out of the company. HR, Legal and other department knows everything but nobody is doing anything and that's how people started looking out.
We should understand the market and devise our policies accordingly.
Managers is very central in MSD. Managers need to focus on the aspiration and development of their team members, but at the same time provide realistic overlook on the organization as a whole. For example: it will not be wise for a manager to promise a promotion when the manager knows that there is no higher position available in the organization.
to keep doing things the same way
In such a large company I feel that communication could be improved and as a new person, I feel my understanding of some parts of the business are limited. I would like to address this.
Involve the employees, Be clear about future plans, try not to create uncertainty.
Spend enough time and resources to ensure that MSD also settles down post Spin-off, there is already too much focus on new projects and value capture within SCM while a huge knowledge shift to Organon should be overcome and you don't do this within a few months
From a professional aspect:  1. Employees should be encouraged to be involved in professional conferences and events to be up to date and get inspired by innovation 2. Mark should provide employees with the best and most professional equipment on the market in order to allow more with the best tools - for example: iMac computers, Apple screens and equipment for designers, innovative softwares, iOS & Android smartphone for the use of testing the apps, etc.  From a social aspect:  1. Create social events to form teams 2. Guide managers the importance of empowerment of employees 3. Accompany employees by mentors for career development in the organisation
find more effective ways of assessing people's workloads; i find that managers are hampered in their ability to accurately assess this. i am not bashing managers. Much of this is due to the nature of the work. It has always been a problem.
Help rid the world of Covid-19
Already is. But to be better, directors should be more concerned with people management, and give managers greater autonomy. Having a structure of coordinators below the managers would be important, if not, the cumulative work gets very complicated.
Include team members in changes that will affect their work.
Merck needs to place more emphasis on critical job skills and stop focusing so much on culture.  Our mission is to make the world a healthier place by bringing important medicines to the people, but we have gotten distracted from that mission.  Our society has significant issues to resolve, but Merck has been placing a disproportionate amount of its internal attention on addressing those ills instead of making us better in the arenas we compete in.
Pay structure needs re-evaluating.  Long gone are the days of reps staying because of loyalty, pensions, etc.  Salary swings of $80K in oncology is sad.  Incentivize reps with other prizes than Inspire Points - big deal when just anyone can send Inspire points to any person for anything - that is not motivating.  Re-evaluate how Diversity and Inclusion is being discussed.  The culture here at Merck Oncology is becoming too one sided and is driving those that don’t agree with the “Merck side” away.
Walk the talk. New perspectives don't seem to be valued as much as how it's always been done. Invest in your employees.
Build / rent some company health centres for employees & families.
For those who want it, find a way to help develop and advance people, beyond their current roles.  Understand that "top talent" is about opportunity to participate in "grand" initiatives, and may not represent all the talent.  Put the responsibility on me as an employee to seek out opportunity, but enable that development and career planning per the work I am willing to invest into it.  IF this already exists, I am not aware, for I am constantly seeking opportunities to develop and highlight my talent for leadership.
1. Mainly based on the emails received from leadership, it feels like politics have now become intertwined with work. One benefit of my job is that it took me away from the stresses of our political climate. Now it's more difficult to separate the two, work and politics, when I'm receiving emails on that topic in my work inbox.   2. Have meaningful discussions with employees about their future and goals. Sometimes we get too focused on the now that we neglect development.
don't punish the good for others bad doings
Continue to invest in our people.  The efforts made thus far have been recognized and appreciated. When I am whole and healthy and not overwhelmed by all that is going on, I deliver better on business objectives and am more able to meet the needs of  customers and patients.
Focus more on risk based decision making
I think it would be helpful to offer employees the option to continue working from home after the pandemic.  Of course attendance at important meetings could be part of moving forward but many of us have become accustomed and set up our home offices and it would be preferred to have the option to have home as primary work site moving forward.
Make processes less complicated for implementation.
There is always a lot of push back on any attempts at innovation.  Managers with more emphasis on process than science limits their ability to manage effectively and be inspiring leaders.
There is still some culture of blame-shifting and cover-my-back which is not nice to work in. I just want to do the work by good collaboration without having to watch my back.
Provide the flexibility for employees to work from home
Job security Deal to be made as promised Stop promise star and sun if company cannot make it
To encourage managers and above, not to work long after working hours & no emails flying at night or over the weekend
Provide more office tools to continue work from home. ( Comfortable table & new labtop/service the current labtop) Internet allowances.
MSD has the best workplace environment in the industry. It should keep doing the same.
Open culture with support from First line manager. There should not be negativity in team. Growth for potential employee.
New products
Proper planning , smart working positive attitude
For personnel WFH - provisions to allow for equipment for an ergonomic work set up e.g. an office chair.  Allow flexible working arrangements and continued options to WFH  Introduce the option to purchase annual leave days and opportunities for leave of absence rather than people feeling they have to leave if they want to for example take time out to travel.  More emphasis on furthering education and providing opportunities to people who wish to do so
Set realistic goals given the pandemic.
Consider leaving us be at home, not having to go back so much to the office in the future
Implementing simplification by true mean to reduce workload.
CHANGE THE GEAR ACCORDING TO COMPETITION AND MARKET NEEDS . DEVELOP THE TEAM AMD GIVE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY CONTRIBUTES MORE .
Transparency , Recognition and elevation
Keep on actively supporting the people working in the company - this will lead in loyal employees that support the company in return.  People make the company! There needs to be more platforms / surveys to include the management of managers / managers of other support functions - thus the culture and health of the company.  There are currently no such platform to evaluate support of managers in their supporting roles = GM's / BUM's / SM's / PM's / Tech Managers.  These people are playing vital roles and the management need to be aware of any needs / - without the fear of being victimized.
Expand parental-leave policy to a sabbatical-leave system, in order to be equitable and inclusive toward those employees who choose not to have, or cannot have, children.
Allow a smooth transition from WFH. Although working from home, everyone has shown that we are able to work efficiently. Allowing people to decide on how often to come on site based on need would help with mental health. Also, Mental health days should be provided to employees. With working from home, some can be on their laptop all day everyday and allowing days to step away and take a mental break will help the company in the long run. In addition, please consider re-adding GIFs to Microsoft teams. That tool allowed for better commination within the team in a virtual world.
Continue to put people first and remain flexible through these unprecedented times. Merck has been awesome at making sure people are able to balance the needs of the company and their personal needs.
There is a lack of Human Resource accessibility and interaction. I am fairly new to Merck and at times I have been hesitant and unsure of where to go with personal questions.
Leadership should strongly consider making roles remote/work from home (WFH) or increase the frequency of WFH. While this has been done during the pandemic, I think there is opportunity for employees to maintain better work/life balance when WFH. Additionally, competitors are moving to make roles 100% remote. Talent retention may be an issue if this isn't explored further. Separately - digital technologies being implemented for Deviation Management (QN at a Glance) are not really valuable to me. I have an easy to update spreadsheet that is much more user friendly and faster to use. I have shared with the DM above site team.
Become more agile. Processes for innovation are heavy.
Workplace flexibility and work-life balance
Travel allowance should be dynamic as per petrol price in country. Outstation and Hotel Allowances must be increase as we could not find Hotel and manage our work in current allowance.
Could cooperation well between  the medical and commercial team. I know in the police we couldn’t know what they do before indication be approved. I just want to know how to follow in next step(when indications been approved).
SIP has been a huge mistake to implement. I wonder how these decisions are made as it hasn't added to productivity and efficiency at all, on top of it, it's been extremely time consuming trying to work something that doesn't and relationships with sites also took a hit.
In this digital age, many teams are remote. More oportunities to connect: EMP Cohort is GREAT, but more of these initiatives are needed, globally. Are marketing meetings planned for marketeers to emulate amongst themselves? In Euram or even globally? Can global key members coach/accompagny members in the countries?  Include more team members outside of Pharma/medicine & FOSTER their ideas: increase their proportion in pharma heavy teams. Ensure people rotation (liek FMCG on 3 year basis)=> get people to think outside the box & ensure onboarding can be done smoothly (right now knowledge is only in people's heads because they don't need to make it available any other way).
Embrace New people Culture.  More training resources Use trello as account planning tool Use docu sign
I would suggest to invest more in education like yellow and green belt to develop our people, as well as make it easier to grow within the company or within your division.
Listen to the people. Not only the management, but to the ground people as well. Management not always right.
I am happy with MSD and how they look after me.
I’m very satisfied with the company way
1. To support people more to be more equipped when it comes to delivering their work specially when they are new as we don't have a systematic on boarding system , you have to reach multiple sources in order to get your answer .. no clear reference point  2.to have a clear developmental plan for people to match their current competencies , not necessary promotion but for any next role there should be a clear communication with the person on what he or she is good at and what to expect as a next role matching his/her competencies   3.Support Mental health more
It would be great focusing on retaining the talents in the company while continuing new recruitments.
We as a company are not acting fast enough on internal but as well external opportunities. When we have internal experts on a specific topic (biology target, past program expertise) we should be agile in staffing programs with these experts instead of assuming that everyone can do the task because everyone at Merck is a great scientist. For external licensing opportunities, we should have a system in place that would facilitate timely reviews/assessments of assets. I have been participating to multiple pre-evaluations and I am disappointed by the slow process. This can be viewed as a lack of interest by the external party.
Expand its portfolio through new pipelines to generate new opportunities for career pathway
I have had a phenomenal experience at Merck since I started as a contractor in October 2019 and then hired full time/permanent in November 2020.  I've worked with two teams with amazing management and leadership.  I feel truly lucky to have work with the people I do and to contribute to Merck's success and helping patients.
Gender equality pay.  Managers should be held accountable for our core leadership strategies.  We need to promote from within first!  We need to change what the sales model looks like.  We are stuck in the old pharma sales model.  We should embrace new ways of working remotely.
Actively coach and develop people.
Continue their D&I work and encourage managers to be more open with their direct reports and create a safe space for them to express their views.
Give support when its needed to provide work balance including additional resources to ensure to maintain capacity capabilities and satisfaction.
Deliver better conditions to work at home, chairs, screens, desktops, internet connections
Refresh management culture. There is little to no room for new ideas in current leadership. There is no motivation to bring forth new ideas and accelerate innovation because management is a closed off echo chamber of older, white men. Merck talks a lot about being inclusive, but there appears to be little of those policies in practice. If Merck wants to retain younger talent, leadership needs to think about how they interact with the people that develop/execute the products services that comprise this business, and plan for longer term workforce sustainability.  I struggle to see a future at Merck because there are limited examples of technical staff that work their way up; management appears to mainly be composed of brands that were acquired or outside hires. Moving up in pay bands or position appears to be insurmountable, despite outperformance on annual priorities. Overall, the employee engagement and retention practices are poor.
promote from within
As an employee that worked on site every day since the start of the pandemic, it was very disappointing to see the AIP was cut to 87% this year.  Its hard to imagine that Merck didnt perform well in a year of a pandemic, especially with all the extra hours I worked to support covid vaccine operations.  The company needs to make more thought out decisions before rolling them out. As a manger here I was first told to discipline employees that are wearing masks when the pandemic started. I was then later told to discipline employees that refused to wear the company provided mask. I was finally told to withhold discipline regarding masks for Union employees. This back and fourth direction shows weak leadership
increase pay rates and remove outside contracts and replace with MSD contracts
Increase diversity at senior leadership level
Keep doing what they are currently doing to make it a great place to work
While Merck may not offer the most competitive pay rates, I think they could make up for that with vacation benefits.  At another company I was able to buy a week of vacation every year at enrollment time.  This was a really nice option, you could also sell back a week of vacation if you didn’t plan to use it. Also the company did a summer shut down around the 4th of July week in addition to the year-end shutdown.
Keep supporting your employees like you have been, ensuring Work-life balance and remote work is possible when appropriate. Transparency about how Merck will grow after loss of spin-off products will help employees feel secure in Merck's future, and their job's future.
Merck should make concerted efforts to examine and assess safe work environment for its employee.
Manufacturing departments will benefit from stabilization measures. There has been lots of personnel and procedural churn.
Drive Agile top down as well as bottom up.  With the pace of information, and the number of projects/meetings/areas to focus on, there is a lot of inefficiency created.  We need a framework (and Agile happens to be a good one) to approach our work with intention rather than randomly.
Translate the open mind and inclusive speach into concrete actions. Currently wat we really have is a nice speach to sell a positive image to the market, but not genuine implemented internally. We still have leader with strict and excludent mindset. They like the diversity just if the diverse is igual to them.
Reevaluate to increase the Chronic Care Rep target bonus of $31,000 - haven’t had any adjustment in over 10 years. Wish summer hours would apply to all employees including the sales force, especially after this last year and a half.
Fix your staffing issue. When I joined two years ago, the bar to hire had been set very high. Since then, it seems as if the bar has been lowered significantly. We have individuals who do the absolute bare minimum, make consistent documentation mistakes, are not team players, and abuse their work time. I have seen analysts watching movies/TV on their phones while waiting during testing, resulting in an unusual amount of errors that could be EASILY prevented. There are individuals with poor attitudes stating that they are not a team player, prefer to work alone, that they will not do anything that does not benefit them. Does this really sound like someone Merck wants to be representing? I have also witnessed this individual leave well before their 40 hours (although they are salaried). I have seen this on multiple occasions- which is utterly unfair to those of us who are consistently putting in overtime, going above and beyond, doing others' tasks because they were not performed correct
do a better job at portfolio prioritization and resource ulilization. remove waste, re evaluate Safe By Choice training and its efficiency/applicability, more attention to people development
Actually having managers that are open to hearing feedback and suggestions from the lowest levels of employees.  Respect for the voice of the first line employees would be of great value for the site and company.    Here is something else to think about.  Is this survey really voluntary when your manager is insisting that you complete it because metrics from MMD corporate indicate that our site is the lowest responding site and this result reflects negatively on our site.
- Praise innovative people
1. Continue efforts towards broadening Diversity & Inclusion training and workshops.  Change takes time.  People get exhausted. But a structured training in mylearning among other efforts/requirements need to continue. 2. Flexibility in the workplace. Great strides have been made recently about doing AIP work in the field and not having to move to HQ.  In addition to allowing top talent inside without the standard 3-5 year pharma experience.
Promote a better work life balance
Stronger direct management support in developing employees.
MSD is one of the best companies to work for. I am proud to belong to MSD
better work life balance
We need to be a more nimble, agile organization that works in an aligned and integrated way.  We need to shift mindset and behaviors to be equipped to succeed in a digital ecosystem and become a learning organization.
Ensure that personnel in non-site based roles are kept as connected and informed as personnel working on the manufacturing sites
Review salaries to ensure competitive. Would be good to see Rob Davies and EXCO hosting virtual Country Trips.
Local townhalls (digital) to share information on plans.  Integrate and symplify global and local procedures & processes Improve and symplify HR service and accessibility (my parenteral leave, could not be administratively registerd within half a year time, I am awaiting financial consequence now for 5 moths salary)
Live as we learn. And let people be diverse, let people make mistakes that gives us experiences, and include employees in the team. Grow away from micromanagement.
Focus on innovation and decrease of processes complexity
People in higher positions should "visit" the areas they govern frequently to stay in the know on daily issues causing a delay/struggles on meeting goals. More often than not decisions are made with unrealistic goals/deadlines in mind. For example the weighing balances were just thrown out with an implementation date with no training on the new balance, then you ask why are there QNs? Next, you cannot visit once when there will be an inspection and expect improvements in a few days. Help your team meet YOUR goals by being part of the team, lead by example, know who needs to make improvements and have those conversations. Help your team by asking the correct questions and providing follow-up even if they are not the answers your team is looking for.
Have a determined focus on reducing workload for employees - multiple priorities reduce excellence and efficiency
Continue to develop and acquire new and novel medicines with the focus on patients.
I feel that wearing a mask at work should be voluntary in outdoor space. Also, if I am alone in my office space and there are no people around, I should be allowed to work without wearing a mask. I find this very hindering to my daily business, my health and well being.
Continue with its drive for excellence in research to discover and develop new medicines and keep a strong focus of diversity, inclusion, and developing its employees. I wish that Merck had this positive environment 10 years ago when I began working for Merck. I think that the more that Merck shows that it cares about its employees the more that Merck will receive from its employees.
Truly sponsor making decisions at the right level. Reduce the amount of forums it needs to make decisions. Prioritize digital innovations that allow us to waste less time and leverage RPA to automate the unnecessary things we do. Take the lead from Organon on truly sponsoring new ways of working. Make it safer to challenge each other to do what is right for the company.
More recognition of the challenges the pandemic has put on people and work / life balance. The work from home / longer hours has become the new normal. This is not sustainable longer term.
- Training and Skill Development - Rotation and promote internal talent - Diversity Inclusion
Be more diverse and innovative.

Strong commitment to Science!
vaccine project for Covid were stopped
Am worried the company LT is detached from the current mood/emotional state of the wider Merck community. Also concerned about our long term position on the global market.
An aging product portfolio and increasing access challenges.  Hoping that the product pipeline performs.
No prospect of promotion in my department,  cannot see a clear direction for my department. I must sat that i'm being swayed by the organization.
I just joined the company. There is a lot of change going on, it will be very interesting to see how it all plays out. It is being reiterated by senior management that we are all about innovation. What I am seeing on the ground is a lot of defense, make Keytruda even bigger. Without new ideas and more risk taking, the excitement is muted.
Chronic care products lack viable science to compete
Disappointed we did not get into the COVID19 vaccination scene immediately. The obvious political statement Merck was making to the POTUS at the time is disheartening.
I hope MERCK becomes more focused on getting new products in development to market faster to allow more of an impact of the new products on the marketplace.
Focus on Oncology and new products are very exciting; i bit disappointed with our failures in COVID19, but hopeful for monupiravir
While I am so grateful for the progress being made in certain focused treatment areas, I am concerned that the chronic care division is in jeopardy because our pipeline is primarily geared toward oncology and vaccines.
Yes, I am confident that MSD Animal Health is the reference for Brazilian Market and we are in the right way to keep Strong and market leader.
We have incredible opportunities ahead of us, especially as we look to build a new approach to animal health that combines traditional biopharma with technology.  There will be challenges but I am very excited about the future.
I feel that we are a bit of a "one trick pony" and that the focus is very much on oncology and everything else is a bit of an after thought. This does make us quite vulnerable to disruptive technology, eg mRNA vaccines. I also am a bit concerned about MRL ability to identify and develop the next "big" thing, especially of outside ONC. The old adage of "first in class, best in class" had not been that evident recently eg: SGLT2i, GLP1 RA, PCSK9i, mRNA vaccines
Looking forward to the future
absence of promising pipeline products
R and D is positive.
Merck’s emphasis on “doing the right thing” has really been on display during the pandemic.  I’m proud and appreciative to work for this company.
I guess the finalization of the spinoff will be important to alliviate the huge demand we have been receiving.
My years here are limited. Looking forward to retirement.
Excited about Merck's future but not our site's future.
feels some what insecure
With changes in leadership and increased dependence on Keytruda would like to understand where our growth will come from
I am a little nervous with all of the leadership changes.
I am excited about the feature of the organisation.  They are innovative, they are worldwide, they are striving to be  No. 1  Pharmaceutical company and not shy to say so..  They have taken over and merged with other companies and have succeeded.  Their recent vaccine Keytruda is a success, so yes I am excited to where they are heading...
I'm concerned about the level of training technicians and managers are receiving. Over the past 5 or so years, training employees has taken a backseat to getting product out the door. New hires are leaving because they're being offered one shift by HR and then the department needs change and their shift is changed. New hires are leaving because training is not a priority and they are frustrated.
A bit concerned about over-reliance on Keytruda.  Merck MRL has not significantly developed compounds for the Company's portfolio for quite some time.
No new products/ combinations  in diabetes portfolio is expected.so CVM ‘S future remains uncertain.
Unsure of Future
Could be a little more transparent with what our future looks like...in regards to a strategic plan and business goals.
I no longer feel that I am working for a leading pharma company, when I only hear my company being praised on diversity. I understand this is a milestone, and we want to achieve it, but I believe the primary concern and direction of the company, and what the company should be known for is for Innovative drugs/vaccines to tackle today's challenges
We are becoming very focused in oncology.  Hopefully we stay committed to other areas as well (and also allocate resources to those areas as well!!). While oncology is huge for the company (understandably), it is also important to allocate adequate funds/resources to fully support the other therapeutic areas that we cover. Otherwise, we could be at a competitive disadvantage vs those companies that are really focused/investing in their assets (outside of oncology).

Wifi/Internet allowance should be increased since  we are WFH most of the time.
Some additional IT/computer stuff for home office would be appreciated (monitor/screen, etc.)
During the field work, Late night meetings and field working create issue with my family life. In the evening at least I should have 1 hour for my family. Abnormal Administrative work on laptop also cause problem for family life. There should be some restrictions or guidelines for admin work. Which may not be productive work for business growth. Or that should generate by system which will save time of field person.
A year into the pandemic I am puzzled by the fact that we still did not manage to give employees a budget to ensure their working from home conditions are good. We really risk people developing serious back issues by working in sub-optimal set-up. And with the forecast of working from home at least a few days a week, honestly this needs to be addressed with high priority. We need to ensure employees get a budget to support working from home 5 days a week.
I have a great manager who has great leadership, diligence and communication and skills
There are a great amount of departments and it might be hard to seek for some specific help. Is it possible to have a directory-like tool to learn the general responsibility of each department?
additional staff is needed to keep up with our workload.  Lab supplies are in short supply.
I appreciate the fact that within the last year we have been able to adapt some things more quickly than usual
No coupons to distribute? Really?
This is true for my current role but has not always been the case
Less restrictions for ffms, mmfs, etc. would be super helpful
I think it is a challenge when we are locked down with Covid restrictions. Merck wants more learning& development, more personal development etc. We are tired of continuous virtual conference calls. In commercial operations - it is all about sales numbers. It generates all our business. We need to be in front of customers.
We need access to large practices (over 25) virtually and access to food trucks to deliver lunch to our customers who request them.  According to my number 3 volume account, Merck is the only oncology company not offering these options to the practice.  I haven’t been in this customer cancer center since early 2020, and I don’t see how I can see them while they are trying to protect patient lives by inhibiting access inside the center.
At this time, it's fine but seemed increasing workload due to many processes and impact from other function's business.
We have resources but it is quite hard to reach appropriate contact out to help you when you are new. This can take time
There are ample resources to do our job however with strict policies in place such as RAT tool and policy 3, it is challenging to execute the use of the resources.
Please send the RAT tool out earlier. We need to know if working live or remotely with more advanced notice.
I think we need a laptop at our houses for the office. I think an iPad only is very limiting to some of the office stuff.
My team is under resourced both human resource, budget, and support from some business leaders.
We talk about diversity but we often can’t get our resources in various languages. This makes it difficult to do my job well.
Agree mostly, but taking into account that the workload is very high and there is no system that backfills support needs in case of emergencies. Additionally taking into account that a growing pipeline needs multiple people to support programs challenging the direct availability of people when they are needed.
Keep the digital coming in a manner our Customer’s like
The budget îs cut every year
a lot of support and resources
I feel that the needs of my customers require an in person presence.  While I value that Merck is concerned for my safety, my customers (for the great majority) have opened up to in person engagements and have stopped doing remote.  Having had Covid and received the vaccine, I wish I was allowed to go into offices that preferred in person engagements
Turn around time still takes a while, but getting better.
My Department is still living in the 70's, which makes my job harder and not ergonomically friendly!
To some extent. It goes back to my concerns about marketing listening to the field and being able to pivot quicker.
Absolutely 0 shortage of resources here at Merck. The trouble may be finding them (can be a bit overwhelming there is so many, and oftentimes in a bunch of different places), but it's easy to find a person to ask who can help you find something. I know that I could ask anyone for help and they would, even if they don't know me at all - that's just what people are like here. I've only been here for about 3 years, but I've never met anyone who isn't willing to go above and beyond to help out a colleague... Truly an amazing company culture. It's about the people!
The hiring process has slowed down since the pandemic and some roles are not being filled. This puts a lot of pressure on the people working hard to not only do their job but fill the gap
I am very grateful that in MSD, we are fully equipped with the resources needed for us to work efficiently and effectively.  The different tools of trade, marketing budget for our programs and other forms of support for the overall well-being of the employees.
No access to a laptop, impossible to ONLY use an iPad and be expected to look at business in spreadsheets that cannot be saved or sorted in certain APPs.   And look at a TINY iPad screen all day.
I'm too new in my current role at this time.
I have the tools I need. IT systems could be more up-to-date

private commitment that is happening at the same time as my main priorities this year. That COVID never seem to pass.
relationship with people in my team.
mental health
It is a strange world we are living in, and strange things are happening. But I try not to much bother about this as there isn't much I can do about it. I just have to take care of myself and my animals
A couple of key concerns regarding MSD: 1) the ability for the company to ensure a long-term balanced growth potential, ie. not to be perceived to depend too much on Keytruda. 2) talent development in Finance: I would like to company to move faster and to take some additional risk to move people faster in bigger roles.  career progression tends to be very slow in finance.
Other:  Overall work life balance
Work from home support, future (if we will be back in the office or not), if the MSD will be competitive on the market in terms of sallaries
psychological well-being
Office politics.
decline of biodiversity due to globalwarming deforrestation and other human activities. I am wondering how much desert we will have in 2050 and how healthy the green landscapes will be.
I am worried about the vaccination strategy in Europe and about not getting the COVID 19 vaccination in my country of residence (Belgium) fast enough. The process is, to my mind,  far too slow and I would feel safer for myself and my family if vaccinated. Will the local MSD affiliate organize vaccination for staff or do we need to wait for the local authorities' long process ?
headcount not enough and hiring freeze
Career progression and opportunities
work/ personal life balance
Work/life balance and burnout
Internal politics and Ageism
I am concerned that managers/site leadership does not keep the best interest of the employees (especially at the bottom) in mind. Its one thing to preach it and say it but its never actually carried out. "be mindful" but then you drown us, its very contradictive.
Career opportunities and focus more on a diverse candidate than the qualified candidate.
I feel the majority of the local leadership team are disconnected from the folks working in the labs. There is very little visibility and 1-1 connectivity
Promotions, raises, Money, getting back to a version or normal, traveling, getting married
I am most concerned about limited career development opportunities available within Merck.  Most people at the higher levels are satisfied being in their positions for a period of time and are not looking to broaden their breadth of experience.  This limits the openings and opportunities available for others.  In addition, my observation has been that if you don't go to the 'right' school, then your career pathway is limited to the opportunities that may be available and it hinders not only the initial entry but subsequent assignments.  People that are minorities and women often have to work harder to prove themselves and even then are restricted as to what they can accomplish if they don't have the means to attend an Ivy League or similar caliber school.  As a company, we need to do a better job of ensuring fair opportunity for all individuals.  Perhaps this could be achieved by mentoring individuals to get experience in positions of interest rather than denying them the opportunity.
Not enough people getting vaccinated & the anxiety over going back to "normal".
Family
Getting back out into the field to make a better impact on customers and patients
My mental well being having worked at home for over a year.
To get me and my family vaccinated during this pandemic. To have a better health insurance. To be able to provide quality time to my family.
Work/Life Balance and Career Progression/Growth
lack of promotions
Work-life balance
Company future and performance (country focus)
Team effectiveness, through Work-Life balance and support to take time to stay healthy (with closed sport facilities) and flexibility in (response) time for employees with family situations (older parents, small children, sick partners, etc). Healthy employees that take care of private situations are more effective and creative.
Trying to reduce gross to net on the back of the independent vets back while we continue to drastically increase discounts to even the smallest corporate groups
Work/Life Balance
Finances are always a concern.  Would love to see Merck do another assessment of base salaries (not bonus/commission), and reward employees who have several years of Oncology experience with a higher base salary.  I know with 100% confidence that with my 5 years of Oncology experience at Merck, I could now leave Merck and make a minimum of $20-$25K more on my base salary by joining any number of other large and stable pharma companies in Oncology.
Work-life balance in 2020 and early 2021 was terrible. My manager was made aware of it and it seemed until new people were hired, there was little that could be done.  It affected my health, reduced time for myself and caused me to have to isolate myself to focus on deliverables for my Merck work in order to meet deadlines.  I'm concerned about the future of our industry given the current political climate in Washington. We know there is already a lot of pressure on our industry regarding drug pricing and I am concerned that will only continue to increase which leads to my concerns about job security. Lastly, I think senior leadership should be less focused on political statements and more focused on our core business and our patients. Political statements can be distracting, have consequences and alienate a good portion of the workforce. Internal communications (such as Merck Yammer) frown upon political comments/conversations and this should apply at all levels within the company.
COVID and it's consequences to travel for work and holidays.
I do not like having politics integrated into my work life. I don't think the company should get involved with politics beyond the issues that directly impact our products or ability to produce.
Working a whole new territory during COVID is not easy and causes stress.
Changing the way we work, for Merck's future success.
Industry disruption
Workload - too much with no clear end. Stressful
1) The future work environment and the pressures of remote working and 2) resources invested in developing current workforce into adopting the transformation currently underway at Merck
Overig = the job is fragmented into many different projects and other tasks
Family
internal politics, misalignment between functions, and empire building (with limited value) have a serious negative impact on our ability deliver the right outcome.
proper work/life balance
Inconsistency - between different leaders at the same time, and/or from the same leaders over time (i.e. in the five minutes between when we talk about what is important and then where we are spending our money). Focus/priorities and how they are interpreted still seem to be changing more quickly than they need to be.
Driving Sales of Priority Products
Lot of experimenting.  Need to move experiment results into standard work.
getting some reprieve from the current work load and some vacation time to refresh
Work Life balance, remote work
Work Balance and quality time
Slow processes at work, decreasing agility and ability to be responsive.
During product launches, its imperative to minimize territory vacancies. It is difficult to find qualified candidates through the contract company in high cost of living areas, due to the comparatively low salary that is being offered.
Would like to ensure that adequate budget is made available for headcount, acquisition of new compounds, and conduct of innovative trials
in the coming weeks i will become a parent, so the work/ life balance is shifting and i am still recovering fro m covid-19. these 2 things made it really hard to manage a good balance as reintegration had to be combined with the preparations of becoming a parent.
Since my husband and I live in a different country than our parents, we are concerned that we have not seen them in person for a long time.
The death of ethics and redefining of morality in the world and the USA.
Work Life Balance and the ability to work remotely some part of the week.
It seems we have become a more polarized nation. We don’t have to agree about every aspect of every issue in our lives. We don’t have to vote for the same candidates to be champions for each other. We should see disagreement as an opportunity for learning and growth.
I need to be very careful not to express any opinions that may not conform with the current company thinking.
Leadership, from the CEO to directors, thinking or believing people under them share their thoughts / believes in what they consider "social and or racial injustice" in the US. They may try to consider what other perceptions there are of the same incidents out there. Not everyone support the BLM movement since many believes it's hypocritical and based on a fake narrative. When has there EVER been a BLM march for a TRULY innocent black child murdered by another black person? Name one. Not everyone believes G. Flyod was a victim. Perhaps leadership should convey the importance of personal responsibilities instead of playing the victim card and ignoring the actions of criminals. Perhaps leadership should consider not everyone is a mindless or misguided lemming.
Work load and related mental stress for myself and co-workers
Work life balance
Relationship (both non-romantic and romantic) and marriage, which will give me much more wellness in the long term.
Police Reform and impacts on my family as a law enforcement spouse.
I have concerns with the low volume of new studies.  I would also like more feedback on my performance - I have meet with my manager 2 times since becoming a Merck employee.  Touch points are often cancelled 5 minutes before the scheduled meeting and never rescheduled
Keeping up and prioritizing all that is going on with work, programs, responsibilities while trying to understand and navigate customer engagement that is appropriate and meaningful to each customer in their respective circumstances. I appreciate the flexibility Merck has offered employees to help meet these challenges.
Opportunity to be agile in the items we work on.  Feel we should shift resources as needed to help out other areas within our division that may be hit with unprecedented workloads.
