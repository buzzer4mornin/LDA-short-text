Different verticals create more hurdles. Due to uncertainty, who has to approve further or which department or verticals, the things go slow.
Being in a transformative phase for almost past 2 years, the re-organization takes a major part and all other tasks take a back seat or waiting for go-aheads forever.
As Global company, we are quite often stucked in processes coming from the US/Global, and it is difficult to adapt or to challenge
There are still too many silo's in operation which leads to duplication of work and re-work in key areas of the business.
in my opinion we should be more agile and remove management layers or structures
Things are getting better as we transfrom into an agile organisation, but there is still a lot of churn and waste that can be addressed. I expect to really see the impact of this once we start acclimatizing to the new way of working. It is still very new.
right now my department appears quite chaotic following certain key retirements and the institution of new leadership and rearrangement of the organization
MY Department does do a good job at removing barriers, but when it involves certain other dept. area S  (e.g.Ariba is causing most of the slow moving issues currently).
Our technical support and Veeva software systems cause multiple challenges in compliantly and accurately reporting customer interactions.  We continue to face “glitches” in Veeva medical event reporting where customers fall out of calls or medical events and it talked three business days and multiple interactions with customer support and your ctl to rectify.  We also have multiple customers CRNA who will one day be able to have promotional support for bridion and the next day after a synch you cannot report a call on them as the approval for promotion was somehow removed.
Always able to reach out to manager with concerns. Very supportive.
“Barriers” needs to be defined
restrictive practices are placed on the department that are "policy" and can't be removed
I almost selected Disagree for this question.  Example: eTMF "Inspection Ready" switch from the bi-annual report reviews - there is no way for the CRM's to check compliance of CRA's completing the new "holistic review" and as there was already some non-compliance with eTMF review/completion by CRAs, the inability for CRMs to easily check this is going to create larger issues on our studies.
My department (Automation) does a good job removing barriers. But we often get new requirements from other groups that don't get properly streamlined into our workflow before they are implemented. Therefore, we end up adding more barriers than we remove over time. The requirements make sense, but the implementation always fails to streamline work so that we do not get bogged down. And new requirements are always being added. This has caused turnover, and will lead to more turnover soon.
There are so many policies that inhibit my ability to do my job.
MERCK SEEMS TO BE BEHIND OTHER COMPANIES WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES.  ACCORDING TO MY PROVIDERS AND PHARMACIES, MERCK IS THE ‘ONLY’ COMPANY THAT REQUIRES A SIGNATURE TO LEAVE VOUCHERS/COUPONS. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF MERCK BEING ESPECIALLY WHEN LAUNCHING A NEW MEDICATION AND PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR OUR MEDICAL GROUPS THAT DO NOT ALLOW SAMPLES BUT WILL USE VOUCHERS/COUPONS. I HAVE 2 LARGE GROUPS (DIGNITY AND UC DAVIS) THAT WILL NOT SIGN FOR VOUCHERS/COUPONS AND DO NOT TAKE SAMPLES. THESE GROUPS WOULD LIKE ME TO LEAVE VOUCHERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS BUT OUR MERCK POLICIES DO NOT ALLOW US.
We have too many meetings. Many of meeting objectives could be accomplished by people responding in a timely manner via email.
There are continuous road blocks in Oncology which is making our job harder on top of working through Covid and being virtual. It’s impeding business.
Personally, managing the team's capacity monthly and checking on their workload is my priority and the leadership team I'm on does to a degree-- this is not consistent across the organization. There is strong sentiment that more work is being piled on without thought to prioritization or importance because a few leaders want to look good. Everything is perceived as important right now and a bit tone deaf given the pandemic and personal impact that it brings to employees and families. The work load has not slowed down, it has increased exponentially. The employees workday has increased to 10+ hr. days to get things done. How will anyone fit a commute in when we're now expecting this level of delivery?  We're setting unreasonable expectations and creating undue impatience and being disrespectful of peoples time and bandwidth.
It is very difficult to remove barriers when all headcount is dedicated to direct operation.
I am in vaccine sales and for the past year I have mostly been working remotely.  Merck is doing all it can to assist us to remain in contact with our offices.
Yes, for the most part. But we are still doing “check the box” exercises that are not improving or changing our discussions in the field.  These take unnecessary time but we are required to do it.
There are a lot of barriers that we are attempting to remove, but have been unsuccessful (e.g. the RFC process for getting a PO or the difficulty of getting new vendors into the Ariba system.
I am struggling somewhat on COVID barriers. I now have two Moderna COVID vaccinations and still have to wear mask, socially distance, small groups, etc
We have been trying to be more proactive vs reactive and I do believe it is the intent but when we see other  pharma companies doing things that we cannot and it impedes our ability to meet with the customer it makes us shake our heads
I feel that people are not adequately empowered to make decisions or take appropriate risks and this creates an environment where work can only follow one prescribed pathway.  Any deviation requires multiple conversations and takes quite a bit of time, often with nobody stepping up to own a decision.. I'm new to the organization and when I have asked peers about this it sounds like there have been instances where a 'wrong' decision has been met with team members being embarrassed in meetings or management holding this against them for extended periods of time and feeling that they can never live down a wrong decision.  I am quite concerned about psychological safety and opportunities to suggest innovative ideas.
I don't think we have barriers
Issues that require enterprise solutions are difficult to move forward, resulting often in less than ideal local solutions
I feel we have limitations when it comes to such strict policies. These are frustrating more for the customer and limit our ability to engage them. Specifically remote engagements that offer a small nominal boxed lunch.
Currently our department was planning to call us physically to office amidst the COVID situation. I don't think my department thinks about people safety
In my case, i have lost 2 months and ongoing of value added work because of my supervisors need for a reasonable compromise on a simple problem
There are too many trainings, calls and live trainings which slow down our work.
There have been numerous restrictions placed on sales that hinder the fields ability to perform at their highest level.  Sales being an integral part of the organization, and possibly the largest generator of revenue, needs to have more flexibility (compliantly) and the company needs to find ways to allow sales to perform their duties, not find more ways to hinder it.
Over the past year Merck has placed barriers to keep employees from working.  The Competition is out and about but employees are not able to make the decision for themselves what they consider to be appropriate
Many of the barriers are from our regulatory structures - we need to be driving efficiency in our regulatory processes, not adding new requirements in the name of "robustness".
We have multiple barriers to our work.  The first barrier is the RAT tool.  Our customers want to see us in their offices, and our customers believe that if they are open then we should be open to come see them.  Cancelling multiple customer appointments with rapidly declining trends and hospitalization rates, left my customers very confused.  Next, we want so badly to compete in the digital AI space; however, our content and method to communicate still needs to evolve quicker.  Our sales and marketing is very siloed and cumbersome.  We are not fast enough with content.  Finally adult learning says that we learn best in 3-7 min video clips, we should explore this option for customer medical education in addition to our formal medical education.
My department actually does a good job of removing barriers.  I am stating this as a "disagree" here based on barriers that are coming from the corporate level.  Current active barriers to Merck's business statement =  1 - ARIBA Streamline Support = The back end of ARIBA...is exponentially worse than ATLAS.  When issues are submitted, the support center sends out the training materials and then closes the issue with no true knowledge of issue status.  The support function, system and general lack of knowledge by the front line support personnel is beyond disappointing.  Time and money is being lost as all departments end up chasing procurement issues.     2 - "Blanket / 1 size fits all" Environmental Classification Decisions = When regulatory agencies stop taking calls because Merck has decided to go above and beyond...Decision makers and processes have to be reviewed.  This describes a business that is working in Silos and NOT approaching the business from a holistic view point.
We move at a turtle pace and discuss things in meetings for hours multiple times a month that could easily be handled with one meeting or a couple of emails. The amount of work that could be completed through more automated technology is incredible.
I do think our policies surrounding remote engagement ie VIRTUAL EXHIBITS are overly cumbersome and put into place to discourage us from entering the space.
Except multiple platforms requiring multiple passwords, every thing is very fast.
No new products, no innovative plans from product management team,If things work well credit goes to PMT team,if things doesn’t work well then sales team is responsible.
My department is doing a good job, however, I think, external factors are not always doing a good job on that.
In India there is in rate cutting in market but hats off our MD , director and HO Pune team they did fantastic job and take strong action now our work is up to mark
There has been marked improvement, but we're still prone to excessive planning  that still seems to be rooted in the fear of failure/not having it perfect before implementing.
I think they can do better, there is a lot of churn because of internal processes and precedent ways of working. I think if there was more flexibility to try new ways of working and more input gather from the actual job owners there could be great progress in removing barriers.
We try but there are still factors holding us back.
More headcount will be needed with upcoming development timelines. More integration of Machine Learning / AI will be useful, but needs to have formal training given to implement correctly.
Policy 3 barriers are more conservative than other companies.
New ways of working are always promoted. Strong collaboration and team working
We constantly depend on the USA and global team to implement
Our major barriers on ONC side are with the customers and Merck Compliance.  ONC Sales Dept does a nice job supporting what can be controlled
There are often multiples levels/approvals/people to go through to accomplish what should be a relatively simple task. Streamlining some of these processes will boost productivity
Cross-functional collaboration, create templates, challenge region on unnecessary tasks
There is room for improvement.  We can overcome access, and compliance processes by having better knowledge and the right point of contacts to learn in early stages and re-design solutions taking into consideration security, policies, potential dependencies, etc.
This is an area in which my department could improve.  CMC has many different business systems and they can be difficult to navigate.  Business systems sometimes don't interface well with each other and individuals tasked with creating processes and systems are sometimes disconnected from the reality of our day-to-day work.
Restrictions are added with every passing months making customer engaging activities /promotional activities more and more difficult . Consequence management puts all responsibilities on front line people for any possible human error .
Many process changes. Inefficient systems and duplication of tracking information.
Recent changes that are compliance driven are a knee jerk reaction to the OIG report.  They are inhibiting me from full customer access and engagement. Example, 12 meals a year for an HCP at 7 people call on (Oncology). Also, no beverages that have alcohol at a dinner event.
WE UNDERSTAND HOW HIGHLY REGULATED OUR INDUSTRY IS, AND FOR GOOS REASON.  WE ARE CONSISTENTLY SLOWED DOWN BY NEW POLICIES, PROCEDURES AND MANDATES AS IT RELATES TO CONDUCTING REMOTE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENTS.  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOSING INTEREST IN OUR RESTRICTIONS AND THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PUSH MORE MANDATES AND EXPECTATIONS, YET OUR HANDS ARE TIED.
Fully agree we try but we're barely moving the needle on it. After our years of driving this, I'm starting to think we need a top down quick & tough action to really make a difference here
the intent is there but the actual actions / decisions taken had not been consistent
We don't intend to create or keep barriers, but we often do create them for ourselves. We create barriers by trying to meet and align with too many people before actioning things, but people's availability to meet is so strained because we have too many meetings about too many things that this alignment can be very slow, then opportunities get lost because we are not timely enough
We do a good job at removing barriers at the Site level but have challenges with above site barriers
Management hears our feedback on shortage of headcount and make appropriate arrangement
The biggest barrier is Merck’s Compliance department.  Limiting us to 12 meals with our physicians and accounts per year is a big problem.  Our competition doesn’t have the same rules!
I think we can improve it to be better.
Equipment and maintenance take too long to repair or replace key instruments
Merck Animal Health is too lean and push a lot of admin duties on the sales reps.  Sales rep need to sell and not do admin work.  Hire more internal people please.
Currently the biggest challenge to work is overcoming barriers that Merck has put between me and doing my job. This sentiment is shared with peers.

Continue to have programs for employee development in other areas of the business.
Stress management and work distribution
Continued to remove silos. Most teams/departments do not consider what input and impact other teams/departments may have on what they are doing.
Reduce and rationalise mandatory training to that which is directly relevant to your role. Currently it is poorly targeted and compounded by the excessive SOP revisions that themselves create unnecessary training burden. The frequency of re-training for the same SOP has now got to the point where it is counterproductive as no one remembers which subtle change was introduced when, and whether they are still current.
We are so heavily restrained by internal policies and procedures that we are not agile and take so long to deliver materials and resources. By the time approvals are through and we deliver we have many times missed the boat. I don't feel the sales team are valued as they should be and MSD's policy of paying at 50% median market rate will see many talented people go. How can you expect the best ales people if you are only prepared to pay them at a median market rate. We are worth so much more than that and need to be valued more highly.
Foster a culture of fairness and action complaints against workplace bullys.  Align behaviours and decision-making of management with supposed 'work ready' principles.
Regular feedback from our Leaders on what they see happening in our business, what they worry about and what we are doing to combat these challanges
Venture into other Therapeutic Area or increase the portfolio of Vaccine.
Enhance pipeline of products
Roles are not defined properly. (Example : Vendor qualification done by maintenance- it need to be done by procurement) Resources not evaluated based on work load.People are working beyond work hours and weekends . Minimum time for family and personal life. Most of the time used for worklife.
Breakdown the barriers of communication and collaboration; Instead of looking at our own plate, maybe people should focus on the big picture and work together
More elaboration on the information/details on the directions for the teams from the leadership team
A great place to work has balance. I feel that workloads are enormous and juggling this with a healthy life balance is impossible. The expectations at MSD for work load are very, very high. I work average of 10 hours per day and still struggle to keep on top of the work demands. FSP were recently let go, this has led to increased workloads and reduced morale. I love the people and our mission at MSD, it is a special place to work, but if workloads keep increasing I am afraid it will have ramifications on keeping good people.
Transparency, Understanding and 2 ways effective communications with mutual respect
Create more chances for employees to expand their working scope, e.g., rotation opportunities to other co-op departments to have a big picture of how things are working in the industry.
More empathy to understand employees and "truly" listen.  Allow employees to feel safe to share their voices and not afraid of to be judged.  Current status of MSD, most employees prefer not to comment.  Silent doesn't means they are happy, it only shows they have given up the effort to feedback/share since nothing will be improved after risking to feedback truthfully.  We know company is accountable to financial report, upper management, shareholders, but equally, ground employees are the base keeping operations/business going.  It is sad seeing more and more people leaving MSD.
Devise ways to build agility within the company so that MSD could respond to the external environmental more effectively, starting with alignment across divisions and departments, clear implementation plans with RACI defined and assignment of accountability for execution and R.O.I.
ground level people survey and  any  one give the best suggestion give the awards .
Continue to become a company who is willing to hear the concerns and challenges of the employee.
Merck/MSD should be more agreessive in more other company aquistions and joint ventures to meet top-line numbers. This work should involve folks from Non-US region as well. So everyone gets a fair opportunity and experience to work in such type of assignments and rare life-time opportunities.
Employees are the best resources of MSD in order to be successful in delivering our mission. We are all trying to be agile in this situation. Make sure toshow value to employees especially in this time of pandemic. Be aggressive in providing utmost care to those affected by COVID. Offer all support and assistance to those employees in need including their families. Not all have beautiful houses or enough budget to support families. MSD should not let COVID + employees suffer in quarantine facilities or shoulder COVID tests alone. In this trying times, we all need our company to be there for us. Also, in this situation, I hope MSD will not force employees to do face to face coverage especially if lives are at risk of having COVID. It is too risky outside. Some MDs are hiding from PHRs. Our sales targets and MD engagements are also very high. I hope MSD will be considerate in this trying times because performances are greatly affected. We are doing our best to do our jobs.
I feel that during this situation, our company has very well managed and equipped the employee to stay working stable. The WFH mode does not impact myself or my surrounding team performance, especially for those who needs long time to commute to workplace during normal situation. It also created a more supportive environment for my work life balance. I hope WFH would be given as the choice of working option in the future, even after the pandemic is over.
simplify the procedure to reduce the time
Staff's comprehensive career development.
Kindly specify what new pipeline coming in organisation
Keeping staff motivated and engaged - Frequent townhall meetings sharing and reminding company's goals/objectives/pipeline - continue workplace flexibility - continue Yarn sessions (patient/success stories)
MSD as it is goes on introducing different ways of increasing engagement of employees. They should continue doing that and as and when the employees shall be engaged in a positive way we all (company and employees) shall be delivering on our mission.
MSD is going through change, it is important to keep the stakeholders posted about what this change means, how is the leadership addressing employee's concerns etc. It is also important to hear various perspectives and minimise dictates funneling down. Participative inputs would strengthen not only engagements, but also will steer organisation to greater heights
İ trust my company , ihope to wrok a long time in the msd.
Continue to  collaborate across all departments to achieve company’s goal.
In my opinion, a plan for going back to work travel it's necessary for our mindset and productivity. The vaccination campaign works very well and at this point we should know what is next for us. At least some milestones should be communicated to people in order to handle this remote situation.
Enable to work remotely all over the world (eg. ex-US people can work as HQ job rolls)
been focus in the ways of working and empowering employees to maintain the motivation  and wellbeing
I believe that the workload is quite high for everyone: this does not always allow to work with lucidity.
1) To develop and promote new innovative products 2) To provide emploees's developing and an oportunites of bilding a career 3) To create and support divercity and inclusion working environment
Provide more opportunities for cross-functional and geographical mobility. Currently, most of the job postings on Workday, even for the high profile positions, state "no relocation / no visa support". This needs to be discussed case by case, probably exceptions can be made for successful candidates, however the approach when from the very beginning we say, that this is not possible, limits the opportunities to the country of current location. Would be great, if internal candidates were considered equally regardless of their current location / nationality / visa status.
Increase flexibility and employee autonomy; simplify processes; integrate systems, applications, SharePoint.
Value internal candidates more in cross platform opportunities.
Include and promote more religiously observant people. the teamleaders and managers in my workplace are very monochromatic and there is a general lack of religiously observant teamleaders and managers
Although difficult to accommodate everyone's needs, ensure that the workforce feel in their job and work environment what is being preached around mental safety. Further, take a limited number of activities and do them well to help deliver on our mission instead of many initiatives that ask for the same resources
maintain worklife balance even if working from home, there should be a respect to employees personal time after work.
I would like to be notified more upfront about changes. Like REDS taking over RCAM, that was a sudden surprise for me. However maybe I missed the email, since every day I receive around 200 emails.
Our company apparently gives support and value to its people and we feel it very much especially during this pandemic period. We hope this value increasingly go on.
There is a need a real need to simplify processes and then really walk the talk. We see too much in the markets of H/C decrease based on intents of simplification that do not come true or even an increase of requests ....
Merck should be more clear on the path moving forward post Organon spin off
MSD should not overload some people with work and then want great and quick results everywhere. Work should be properly distributed among the teams. Everyone is working from home so our job is not a fun anymore. We don't have a chance to talk to other teams casually or to go for a lunch together and even when the company is trying to add some meetings to help with a work life balance it is not what many of us need. If you are constantly overloaded you don't go for a chill meeting because you know that that no one will work on the pending queries. And what happens when someone takes a vacation? All the work is on other team members that are already busy so they can only pick up some important tasks but in that case they can't work on their other queries and when you are back from vacation you are crushed by all the tasks that piled up. So the most important for me is that MSD's projects are thought through well and all the teams that are affected are informed and asked for a notes.
Resources to effectively, timely and sustainability deliver on mission
check senior management for agile working and empowerment. In GRACS I see sen. manager who do not empower people but at the same time request leadership, which is contradictory.  Too many meetings. Too many review cycles for documents. Again, people are not empowered which slows down the processes tremendously
More engagement between the sites and above site CoE to make positive and meaningful change. The sites do not seem to realize the supports available to them.
increase smartworking days to 3 even after the pandemic.
Continue on this great path... I really love to work for MSD.
try being even more specific about the things like transformation, the reason why its happening and what the outcome should be is not very clear, asked couple of colleagues and their response is the same.
More opportunities for promotion
Focus R&D in areas where we can make a difference to patients and where there is a true market opportunity (the decision to stop developing Covid-19 programmes and focusing on previously established priority areas showed vision, strength and boldness) - not be 'afraid' to take 'unpleasant' leadership decisions.  Continue simplifying(/reducing) processes and IT platforms and tools that can (still) lack use-friendliness, an intuitive set-up and are too complicated to navigate and work-in. If Google, Amazon and Facebook were to use our tools, they would not last a day.  Continue supporting Diversity and Inclusions initiatives and education via external experts.
have an open and transparent policy for communication of current state and new projects coming in
Give a good support to home-work after Corona in terms of working facilities.
As a highly educated and skilled computer professional, it boggles my mind why I have the same limits on a PC as the secretary that has almost no computer skills at all. It takes weeks and weeks to solve small issues through the support that I am fully capable of solving myself. The strict Merck computer system has a high negative productivity impact on employees in positions similar to mine.
too much managers saying "do this, do that" without matching with each other and the people on the work floor
Provide a clear picture and explanation of what the (future) plans for the setup of the workforce are and how they are linked to the company's mission.
Think about the work pressure, we keep getting fewer people in the department, the work load supporting a whole organization is huge. Please be advised that I have a wonderful job and manager but work load is getting bigger and bigger each day!
Create a real culture of inclusion and safety to speak up. Transformation cannot be achieved with old thinking posing as embracing the new way of working.
As a new employee I feel the induction to my job could have been better. There were no guides or conversations as to how I get started with systems I need to have access to do my job.
Introduce a 'respect people's time' policy. Too many meetings are called where it's not clear what the purpose is, why I was invited, my role etc. Meetings that could be accomplished by an email. Respect people's time: provide an agenda, make it clear what people's role in the meeting will be etc etc
Keep focused on inclusion, especially for those working remotely.
More opportunities to volunteer at a local level
Be flexible in terms of KPIs especially during this time of pandemic, must consider that different territories have different characteristics, needs, etc. Cannot apply same parameters to different territories.
Listen to the employee and customers to ensure that we can make MSD a great place to work in and a company that customers (HCPs) would love to collaborate with. We are too KPIs driven, listen to the market and be competitive..
Making decisions at the right level, employees should feel more empowered. This is still such a consensus driven company where the risk always needs to be minimal in whatever we do.
MSD is an Innovator company and should also provide HR policies needs compared to peers. The following things needs improvement. - HR software tools needs to be more user friendly -Leave structure is rigid and different types of leaves should be allowed to be clubbed -Payroll staff needs to be answer the queries properly. -Salary structure can include more flexible options like sodexo or zeta card -Due to Covid situation, most of employees has vacated  their rented apartments from the city of work place and HR should provide relocation while resuming the services for coming back to the same city again - variable pay is on higher side when compared to the peers. -While working from home, company should provide proper compensation for setting up office at home  Apart from that, work wise, Archival system is not adequate and is hard to find the correct submitted document  -
Ask employees what they would like to see at their site. Ways of working i.e WFH Vs On-site Vs. Hybrid. Compressed week Vs. Normal week etc. What do they need to improve the stress of their job through anonymous site specific questionaires
Look into the endless meetings. This is a major contributor to most of us not having a work life balance.
1. to strengthen management skill especially for the staff who stay in MSD for long term period 2. to align with global team to have more flexible working model
With the size of the company often trying to find the correct department or team to make progress is very difficult. This means making progress takes time and regularly much longer than needed.
stop letting good people leave MSD/merck and support them more in their roles. Don't let the managers plan the projects then do nothing to support day to day people doing the actual work.
Continue working as is
I think we should focus on our mission : save lifes. I think we should stop politics. I think we should stop react to some social events even if they are very sad (racism against asian community, Capitol events for instance) because we don't understand why you do not react to other sad events (poverty, access to drinking water, access to education...). Every choice is politics. Merck is not a political organisation.
One of the most difficult aspects of work is that everyone seems hugely stretched with little "wiggle room".  Time is the most valuable commodity. An important consequence of this is that it is very difficult to find time to talk to colleagues with many knock on consequences, e.g., problems become crisis-management because they may have been missed or not addressed at an earlier timepoint.  Allowing people to have a little spare capacity should not be viewed as a bad thing and people should be working wisely and productively, not just being busy.
Continue to get involve with current crisis and continue to support employee to have a well-balance life
increase transparency; ensure adequate resourcing; break silos;
Continue to develop and support staff so that they can continue to perform over time
make agile working possible by stopping needless processes
Further - genuine emphasis on better prioritisation. Learning and empowering to say 'no' more as a MSD culture to give more time for the really strategic projects that really, positively impact patients.
I think that MSD is already doing a fantastic job. I think it is important to keep focus on a safe, but fast, re-opening of office facilities as people are struggling working from home to the extend they are currently doing. I highly welcome creative thinking around a more flexible workplace, that will allow our teams to adapt their working schedule and where they physically work from, to fit their need and private life.
I think as a global company we start to feel the impact of very heavy procedures in all company levels that are sometimes an obstacle to fast response to Market challenges. I think we need to work on flexibility and fast responsiveness.
Move towards leaner organization
haven't been able to develop a Covid medicine which makes me worried about us being research focused (compared to other pharmaceuticals), I would expect shareholders to feel the same. To overcome, we have to make bold moves. I cannot comment on the chance of succeeding, but the future of health companies will be in neurodegenerative diseases such as MS, Dementia, ALS. Developing in that area could bring major benefits in terms of reputation (and therefore talent acquisition) and long term profitability.
A lean company is fine, but it should not be so lean that people are burned out. This is espescially the case in some LS species.
Train leaders. Accept differences among people. Let people come to work as the persons they are. Analyzes of what could improve employees workday. There may be small improvements that could mean a lot.
Workload for balance work and life.
Continue to focus on our people, and as we need to find expense efficiency to meet our long term financial goals, ensure that we are not asking too much from employees in their roles and we are realistic about workloads.
Continue and maybe expand employees opportunities to cross train across sites in order to break down current barriers that exist.
Compensate and reward employees fairly for work well done.
When brining concerns to management, I don't feel heard. I wish managers would take my concerns into consideration.
Inspire and recognize employee's accomplishments more
Ensure mechanisms for work prioritization that focuses on critical activities and deprioritize activities with lesser value.
Provide more opportunities for career advancement at the mid-management levels.  In Finance, it takes many years of experience at one level before being considered for a promotion.
Roles still feel very siloed. At my current level I feel that I am not exposed to workflows, information, and expectations for the next level, so how am I to prepare for and strive to work at that next level?
Focus on our core mission and not distract employees from our core purpose of saving and improving lives through our therapeutics and vaccines.
Its a perfect Place to work in   May be. To take into  consideration the financial situation of the countries to support the employees financially through salary increase
Add more resources for support staff for technical areas.
I worry about retaliation for speaking up about inequities that have happened to me at Merck.  I still feel middle managers hire “like”  people.  I hope we can truly embrace diversity and inclusion at Merck at all levels.
Introduce and encourage flexible (in-person and remote) working arrangement
recognize people for promotions
Purposeful skip level meetings for both leadership and employees to gain greater insights. P5 and M3 split into 2 levels similar to R track (e.g. Director/Senior Director). Promotions are huge motivating factors and additional levels give a sense of an expanded career path.
A vaccinated workforce would be fantastic.  I think if people know when they would get their vaccines it would help in all aspects of their life not just their worklife
I'm an older employee and I strongly feel the value of older employees is not recognized. far too much emphasis on Engineering degrees at the expense of other degree fields and experience. I think Engineering degrees requirements are often used as a way of excluding older people. When an Engineering degree is required for a job that does not involve actual engineering skills, you have to wonder why.
Continue to enforce the use of standards across Merck analyses and reporting deliverables.  This will save time from the start of documenting analysis plans through authoring of CSRs and other submission documents.  In addition, agency reviewers will see the same format to our submissions and become accustomed to that - resulting in fewer agency questions.    Plus everyone knows the standards and can be so much more efficient and have quality outputs!
Further invest in emerging markets to ensure poorer markets and patients get access to our medicines and for this shape the manufacturing strategy to further leverage partnerships and localization to make our products available.
offer more stock options to a wider pool of employees
Communicate plans and progress more openly with employees (e.g. it seems like we get most of the information about the company from the news, rather than internally).
Take steps to ensure environment-friendly measures are in place.
End the culture of fear that exists at Merck. Re-evaluate people’s scope of responsibility. Provide additional resources where needed. Right now, as a Merck employee, the only thing that I feel that matters is the P&L and no one cares about the people
As vaccines are being rolled out and as there are signs of returning to 'normalcy' in the near future, I think transparency around what in office presence requirements will look like would be helpful to allow for planning. What options will we be given, if any at all? I think there is growing anxiety around not knowing anything so even little nuggets of insight or intentions to be broadcasted to the organization would be helpful
Securing jobs, for small plants like Montevideo Site the survival of the site is vital.
continue giving employees a voice and fostering an environment where employees feel trusted by upper management - "unbossed" as another pharmaceutical company says :) this motivates employees to put their best work forward. Our new ways of working are great and we need to continue putting them into action. also, vacation and personal time is key to maintaining a positive balance and outlook. create opportunities for employees to get additional paid time off - (eg, in exchange of inspire points, an extra paid week off after 5 years of service, etc)
Faster decisions at the right level and trust the people that they can make the right decisions
Focus on the science and the business, not social issues.
For Merck to speak out about its shortcomings/failure.  It is no disgrace or shame. Not everything works out. If there is bad publicity in the news, bring it out and address it, don't hide from it. Address the issues.
Remove the ridiculous barriers for earning and receiving a promotion at this company
Streamline, reduce barriers, reduce labor intensive processes, greater utilization of cloud based operational systems
I think that everything the company is doing is making it a great place to work and will deliver on the mission for the company.  The culture at Merck is amazing and I love working here.  I have the respect of my managers and co-workers and I feel that it is the best place I have ever worked!
Continue to let us work from home until there is at least herd immunity so we don't need to worry about our health.
Continue to work in diversity, though be careful on how forceful it is applied.  I feel that small, steady changes add up and are lasting over time.  I'd like to see more diversity appear in mid-lower mgmt roles.  I feel this will have a great effect in a local sense.  Continue at upper mgmt - though developing diverse leaders from colleagues within our midst already will weave diversity deep into the fabric of company.   Continue work flexibility plans and offer (where possible) work from home arrangements for Administrative Staff, as is with exempts.
Merck and MSD should focus on carving out more resources to support D&I across the enterprise and support the divisions in this mission.  Many individuals that are passionate in this space are being spread way to thin to be effective.  It would be a step towards moving the needle and allowing us to be more efficient, more intentional in terms of how we support our employees, our patients and the mission.
Robust discussion on the future of hybrid WFH/On-site working strategy - opportunity for improved worklife balance and in turn increased productivity as a longer term WOW.   Accelerate installation of digital technologies. Focus on increased engagement with end users during the design of digital technologies - what does the end user need these technologies to do on the ground to eliminate potential gaps in technologies after deployment.  Develop tailormade MPS playbooks and roadmap to suit quality, production and supply chain deployments - each business unit has different challenges and functionalities. Playbooks are heavily production focused. Full review of current MPS deployment strategy, is it giving us the benefit we expect at the rate we need? Value realisation is a challenge in the current MPS program. Review and assess connectivity between global and site MPS functions, are they aligned and working together towards a common goal?
Walk the talk. ?Today there was an article in the NY Times on Languishing regarding what many employees are feeling due to the stress of work.  I'm working up to 70 hours a week. The work just keeps piling on. I don't have a director, I interviewed for his job and was told I was doing such a good job in my current job that the interviewer didn't think I would be happy in the job I was interviewing for. I've been here 33 years and have had 11 positions in 4 divisions with great ratings and to have the interview end with my ED saying "I see you in the your current job for the next few months" makes me feel like I am going to be laid off.  Based on how the job description was written (by one of our vendors) and it didn't even mention management of people as a requirement (10 of us to manage), I'm 57 and part of a "diverse protected group" but in viewing the companies diversity training, Baby Boomers are barely mentioned.
Prioritize culture.  Not just valuing diversity when it comes to race, gender, etc. (though kudos on that), but also diversity of opinions and approaches.  Merck rewards outspoken and aggressive approaches which can exclude those with different approaches.  Inclusion of all individuals encourages diverse viewpoints and ideas, and also has the effect of extending inclusion to those who may be hesitant to contribute their ideas for other reasons (i.e. those who are not sure their voice is valued due to differences--racial, gender, other).   Merck also seems to value pure science over applied at times.  Scientific innovation is key to our business, but valuing publications over what they can help us achieve (application of the science, increasing scientific reputation for recruiting, establishing scientific leaders who can interact and _learn_ from external sources...)  Science is how we do the job, not the goal in and of itself. Also, being proud of the company is good, arrogance is not.
Training role out is slow, not yet felt on floor. Not enough leadership at floor level.
Provide the appropriate resources and remove the barriers to get work done.
i think decentralizing decision making will help empower team members.
I think this company is really good at solving problems when it prioritizes them.   The first step to improving is for company leadership to admit that currently, Merck is not a great place to work (I think we're an average big company, and nothing more). The second step is to prioritize solving that problem. From there, the rest will probably work out naturally. If I start hearing discussions at every EBB about what we did this quarter to create more value for our employees, the same way we discuss creating value for customers and investors, I have no doubt Merck will become one of the best places in the world to work.  Unfortunately, right now I just can't imagine that happening.
1. Hire enough staff to make work-life balance a reality. 2. Reward good performance with generous salary increases.
More work from home, less change, more stability.
Keep the company apolitical.
Keep on listening to the needings of the employees, as you are doing now, and address these needings.
Ensure that the benefit of people WFH continues after the pandemic. Stop donating to politicians who support insurrection, fight to limit voting; and  question or fight against the legitimacy of our democracy in the USA, and find ways to protect our business that doesn't involve US citizens paying 2-3X as much for medicine.
Give more employees a fair opportunity for advancement - at all levels, in all areas of the company. I have a team of entry level staff who would love to move into higher positions but there is so little opportunity made available to them. And their additional fear that they will be the ones let go, or outsourced, because of a perception that it's the lower level roles that are dispensable. It's heartbreaking for me, as a people manager, to see how little the company cares about the opportunities for staff who are not ADs or above. Everyone has to start somewhere - we didn't all come to Merck as an AD.
Please continue to allow the personal caregiver/child care benefit, it has been the biggest help for our family throughout this pandemic!  The fact that Merck has extended this benefit every 6 months has allowed my wife and I to fully engage in our professional lives and let our kids flourish with the nanny Lifecare has provided!  If it were not for this benefit, our children’s academics would have suffered.  I’m grateful to serving this company for the past 16 years of my life, and its the only company I’ve ever worked for!  (First job out of college in 2005.). Merck has always been there for us, and I appreciate the company, people, and culture.  Thanks for giving us the opportunity to provide feedback.
More focus in the products is needed. I feel we are lossing the focus on the product and spending more time in additional tasks which will distract us from our true business
Work hard on diversity, inclusion and equity to make them as stronger values of our culture. Break the cultural differences between divisions, most relevant to my role is between MRL and HH.
*Year-end evaluations should be focused more on individual accomplishments where the individual is competing with his/her self and not others.    *Less talk about politically charged issues that could be divisive.
To please stay away from political issues
Continue to allow for the flexibility (remote working, alternate schedules, etc.) post-pandemic even when we are able to return to the office
Continue to make our positions on social justice clear.
push responsibility for working practices down to department heads and not use EY so much
Help the employees that are in other countries besides USA, to get access to the vaccine.  In addition, decisions as remove the GIF function from Teams, are not in accordance with D&I
Continue efforts to encourage diversity and inclusion to promote new ideas from all levels
Continue to drive an inclusive culture.
Update and enhance our tools and systems; improve training (trainings at Merck are focusing on the "what" but are lacking input on the the "how") in order for people and the company to be successful.
If Merck was able to add more resources more easily/rapidly it would make a big difference in the employees workload. Many of us must work 14 hours per day and more due to the amount of work we have.  I've seen colleagues across the world working at 2, 3, 4 am and go on with their workday after it.  Many work that amount of hours during the weekend as well because there is just too much work to do and not enough resources to do it.  This is absolutely unhealthy and unacceptable.  The work gets done but at what price?  After a while, the employees burnout or quit to go work for another company that respects Work Life balance. The health and wellness of the employees should be a top priority for Merck.
MSD seems to have missed the mark with recent acquisitions, particularly with COVID items.  The company also seems to have missed the mark with external communications involving strategy and changes to the business.  Very little is known about the Organon spin-off (perhaps by design), our direction "post-Covid" and "post-spinoff" seems exceptionally cloudy.  I think the new MSD, post organon, should take a serious look at marketing our brand as we look to become more of a nimble growth oriented company.  We'll attract better talent, which in turn will help enable our future.
I believe we do have that company now, its a little that we should take care: ammount of work in order to have more space for the balance in our lifes, and also the home resources that we have at home for work.
Increase salary, opportunities within Merck as well.
Simplify business processes and complexity - takes way too long to get decisions made, requires too much data - analysis/paralysis, too many what if scenario analyses when in the end, decisions are already made well beforehand.  Share strategic direction and point teams in that direction vs asking them to do analyses that in the end are not used and consume a tremendous amount of resources that could be used for other critical needs.
Continued support of our changing workscape.
If they would promote the overlooked staff more it would make it a great place to work.
Continue to address the challenges of employee capacity vs. increasing business demands.
Retain the flexible work policy to work from home if we are currently working from home since the pandemic
Continue offering flexibility for employees in this uncertain time. Continue investing in new R&D.
We have a great internal information piece, The Animal Health Insider. I find we are not good at sharing our story with our veterinary customers. Why do we not also have a piece geared toward our veterinary customers, as piece to tell who we are and the great social justice projects we are working on in NA and globally. We have to toot our own horn, no one else is going to do it for us.
take proactive steps that will allow us to be together at a team meeting in person
Continue to ensure innovation is a priority GDI is a focus Continue to ensure employee wellness and wellbeing  is a focus
Departments and divisions are not aligned on strategy, priorities and resource allocations.  All departments are severely understaffed to execute the work requested, and this creates work/family imbalance and forces employees to make prioritization decisions on their own, or work extra hours to get everything completed.
Increase salary, increase resources to perform good science, insure that the positions being filled are by those most qualified.
I am concerned about the continued direction of downsizing following Spin and expectation that current staff, who are already overburdened, have to pick up transferred colleagues' workload. Besides having a negative impact on personal health and wellbeing, I am concerned about the ability of Merck to remain a GMP compliant company
It is a great place to work
People ownership and clear role & responsibility
Stop the whole mentality of "our way or the highway".  Be open to hearing about other's ideas and not just saying that you are open to it.  There is still a pervasive fear of retaliation when you challenge the status quo, even when it is with constructive solution-oriented suggestions.  Stop building systems and processes without the end-user in mind or the end-user having input into them.  We constantly feel left out of important decisions that impact our ability to do our jobs.  Stop promoting the whole "balance" thing when clearly no one means it.
No steps I enjoy working for Merck and it is a great place to work.
Evaluate there is an adequate amount of resources in each department for the critical work that is required to be completed.
Do not only wanted to receive certification for people working at MDS with less of 35 years...   There are also great professional full commitment with MSD beyond that ages. that provides efficiency and be more stables...
We do a lot. and I am very graetfull. Mayby more soft competency trainings for managers, and reinforce being a good colleague among all of us
I feel extremely grateful to have the option to work from home since last March.  Work/life balance since this pandemic has been very difficult and working from home has allowed me to manage my stress level very well.  I am able to focus on my work and give 100%.  I hope that once the pandemic is over, we will still have the option to work from home.  We are fully set up, and not having to travel is an extra bonus.
connect more with people needs , count on their feedback  and adjust Comp &Ben package to market range especially for senior employees working for many years in the company
Automation
- communicate clear and sustainable IT strategy  - do not rush on new ways of working, experiment carefully with agility and profit as much as possible from collected feedback  - think about bringing multiple changes at the same time (org+ways of working + tactical steps)
Continue to support employees as you shave done during pandemic
I’m not certain that Merck acknowledges the differences across the nations in changes experienced by individuals as a result of the pandemic.  Including children not in school, elder parents needing support (grocery getting, housework etc. for fear of leaving home or having outsiders in their home)
Perhaps better ways to streamline company-wide communications of updates and available resources to its employees
Merck needs to look at processes and systems closely, and improve/upgrade/change to ensure people have what they need to perform their jobs.  A lot of times we waste time on tactical non-value add work because we don't have systems & resources to perform our jobs.  Also, in the day and age of being a "lean" organization, Merck really needs to make sure there are plans in place when people take extended leaves of absence, or leave a job or the company.  This usually means someone else works double to cover, and overall the organization suffers because things fall thru the cracks.  This is not sustainable long term, and will result in people getting frustrated and potentially leaving the company because it becomes too much to manage.
Keep more balance between work and personal life
Expand working from home, at least 2 or 3 days a week.
OUR PAY SCALE IS AMONG THE LOWER END OF THE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE LOST SOME GREAT TALENT FOR 10-20% MORE PAY AND WE HAVE 2 NEW HIRES ON MY TEAM WHO IM SURE ARE LOW ON THE PAY SCALE BUT ARE WORTHLESS IN THEIR SALES ABILITY. I REALIZE MERCK WILL PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR ONCOLOGY AND SOME OTHER DIVISIONS BUT INEFFECTIVE, CHEAPER EMPLOYEES DO NOT HELP DRIVE BUSINESS. MERCK USE TO BE VALUED AMONG OUR INDUSTRY AS A TOP PLACE TO WORK, BUT NOW WE HAVE THE REPUTATION AS LOWEST PAYING AND THAT DRIVES TALENT AWAY.
Continue the Diversity & Inclusion efforts, not only related to gender, but also to ethnical, religious, or whichever background people have. Continue with the diffussion of the good results and sharing personal stories of achievement from the employees.
Start listening to the people in the trenches.  I would love for the senior personnel to sit with our sites and hear their issues with our company - the good, the bad and the ugly.  SIP needs to be re-evaluated, it's been a disaster.  The amount of time and energy it consumes with Merck personnel is overwhelming and effects our ability to keep up with the ongoing changes at Merck. Plus, if you add COVID and how it's effecting our ability to work and the site's ability to work - they are barely getting by with the strain of not going in every day and dealing with COVID.I always thought I would finish my career at Merck, but not anymore. I've been here 15  years and I'm so frustrated that I doubt I'll see year 16.
Investigate the lack of career path for IT Project Managers especially since PM s were moved from a central organization and now sit in IT Divisions. A P3 in ITRMS now has a much much harder shot becoming a P4 in GHH IT because they don't have experience with GHH systems or people. Previously, with the central PMO when a PM's project's ended in ITRMS they could choose work in ITRMS, GHH, or any division. That isn't the case now.
Properly resource so employees are not super overworked and overwhelmed with the amount of additional work that is being heaped onto them.  Working around the clock and on weekends continuously is not a healthy way to live.  The stress takes a toll on your health.
I think we could work on increasing transparency across programs and departments. It is significantly worse at Merck compared to similar companies I've worked at.
Listen to it’s employees.  If you want to be the premier oncology company and retain the best employees, bring us up to industry standards with pay and cell phone/internet reimbursement as well as offering stock options to high performers.
Raise salary and bonus levels for band 400 and lower
Be more clear on priorities and secure priorities are accurately resourced
To meet our mission and goal of "Allergic reaction to waste that leads to focused elimination in all aspects of our business", we need computer systems that are connected and have reporting functionality as a standard and not pushed to Phase 2 that never happens.  At this time we record the same information in multiple systems which is wasteful and leads to errors.  My point of reference is Regulatory Affairs CMC, but I'm sure this is relevant across our business functions.
Senior management team focus on strategic pipeline alignment for next at least 10 years and make better effort to foster a “speak-up” working environment.
Prioritize the work more effectively.    HH doesn't like to prioritize the work to reflect capacity of those doing the work.  This results in a lot of stress/pressure in the system and demands to work outside of normal work hours.
Practice what they preach - work life balance is a great philosophy but we have no time to enjoy all of those benefits with so much work.  All the extras that are offered - meditation hour, remote workout options, mothers for merck, diversity talks - I would love to join all of these things but work committments and other meetings don't allow me to.
Take more appropriate business risk and move faster with business decisions.
Be willing to take a risk on new technologies and opportunities, we can't continue to be successful by being conservative and letting other competitors take the lead.
Recognize and acknowledge accomplishments - large and small. Financial increases are small.   Promotions are near non existent for people who are/were not in UG and known by colleagues on a close basis.
Rethink flexible work arrangements. Be more transparent about the state of the R&D pipeline and how the larger strategy influences and is influenced by it.  Provide feedback on how prior decisions have worked out (i.e. establishing discovery site in London, adding D&I to manager's priorities, acquisitions, etc.)
Break down the silo , create and value SME's and incorporate a safety and compliance culture in a daily work
Too many fragmented organizations within and they operate fairly independently and hard to see how they all come together for a singular mission.
More resources invested in proactively building capabilities necessary to deliver on future products.  Too often we are on critical path trying to build the plane while flying it.  Increases risk which increases stress.
Continue to offer flexible working arrangements to be competitive with other companies.  Continue to value employee feedback and be transparent from the top down.
I am proud to work for Merck.  I have seen the company be very supportive of its employees through my career but especially during the pandemic.
I feel Merck is doing an excellent job creating an excellent culture to work in given all that’s going on in today’s world.  The Pandemic has caused considerable changes in all of our lives and Merck has done an excellent job keeping the employees safe.  The RAT tool has been an excellent example!!!  Merck is the best company and I couldn’t be more proud to work for them for the past 20years!!
TOO many meetings and work teams that don't make an impact and just check off someone's box.   We are trying to get our jobs done and the over whelming number of meetings is hindering this.  We have to work well into the night and weekends just to return all the emails and then get pressure that deadlines on meetings aren't being met.  It's very frustrating.   Also, I think Scott means well to have his people manager and all company meetings but these could be consolidated and shorter.   It feels like they are really reaching for content and now we are having required 20 minute trainings!   It's just over whelming and we could use that time to do our jobs that we are hired to do.   Again, it's all well intended but I don't think senior level leadership understands this impact.
(1) Truly EMPOWER employees - don't have SVPs/VPs review every single document for formatting, punctuation, grammar. A draft takes an average of 20 iterations before it is deemed final. Imagine the time & energy we would save and accelerate decision-making (2) Recognize, respect and leverage diverse experiences. We get hired to Merck for our experience; however that is instantly shut-down because it is NOT the Merck WAY (3) Take risk on people - we continue to stick to our silos; the cross-functional/division talent movement is limited. You have to know senior leaders in functions/divisions to get a role (4) Get rid of the current performance management system; people have tremendous potential, however, will hold themselves back if rated in the middle year-on-year despite extraordinary contributions (5) Truly endorse Talent First beyond paper; especially in the remote ecosystem if employees are demonstrating effective engagements and productive contributions - let them be virtual.
Focus on critical objectives, especially during challenging times, such as COVID and do a better job on evaluating impact and resource requirements before asking the sites to absorb more work (such as QSIP)
it was a disappointment as a long time employee to see that Merck/MSD was not in the forefront of finding a vaccine for Covid.  it seems that we are no longer leading the pack of our competitors.  i am very proud of our company and it was sad to see what occurred.  i think we need to be more transparent on what direction the company is going; where will we be in 5 years.  the stress of the past year has been alot on everyone.  we should be communicating what the workplace will look like when we return and our executives should be sponsoring an unassigned more collaborative work environment.  we have this opportunity to change.
Put ideas into action.  Make diversity and inclusion part of our culture and not the latest hot topic.  Encourage people managers to invest more in their people and developing talent that can move more freely laterally and upwards if they are an ideal candidate.  We need to be more open minded about the ideal candidates who fit the former mold for different role types.
Continue to allow employees to be open and candid. Listen and value our feedback as many of us are talking directly to customers. Even if something worked well in a pilot program or Merck spent resources on a new capability, it doesn’t mean it is actually helpful or useful in real world settings .
Ensure flexible work schedules and remote work remain in place for all employees long after the Covid-19 shutdown is over.
Find an appropriate balance of internal communication about D&I and other priorities in the business. Also, the narrative about diversity seems to be narrowly about race and gender instead of being included along with diversity of thinking, background/experience, age, personality profile, etc.
Be transparent and up front about the changes happening.  Example - the Rahway site is undergoing a transformation with new construction, new buildings for science, existing buildings be renovated, etc. yet it is a secret to only a select few.  As employee aren't we trusted with the information?  Can't we be trusted?  There is a also a lack of transparency when it comes to job postings - some jobs are created for employees yet never posted and then there is an announcement of a promotion.  Other jobs are posted yet once one applies one never gets the courtesy of an interview, weeks after the posting.
It's been extremely challenging to find time to take off work for vacation days given the amount of work on our plates and hours we are working each week. We need to have very deliberate conversations on activities that do not drive business value and prioritize our work accordingly. We take on more work, but do not remove or refocus our work to adjust for a decrease in team size. Additionally, many of us have adjusted extremely well to working full-time from home and would like to continue to do so, but there is concern that when buildings re-open, we will quickly revert to "having to be there to be seen" if we have career aspirations. As other companies have already made the jump to fully remote and have also offered things like an "impromptu" company shutdown week to give their hard working employees a much needed breather, what has Merck considered doing to avoid employee fatigue in this respect?
I think Merck should figure out a way to quantify the impact of scientific upskilling of its employees. It is hard to measure, but can have long term impact on efficiency and accuracy of process characterization and process transfer.
Be transparent and fair with employees for the upcoming LOE with Januvia
Prioritize.  There are many global initiatives (QSIP, IPI, MDR, TOCS, etc) that are coming to a site level without resources or prioritization.  In order to be effective, we need to ensure we sequence the work to allow us to not lose control on safety, quality and supply reliability.  We are excited about the improvements but will need leadership support to ensure proper sequencing.
Continue delivering on our mission for global human health.
We need to get faster, faster.  Our competitors for talent are small, lean and effective -- and more intrinsically rewarding to work at.  Merck should continue its WOW campaign to increase collaboration.  It should also remove functional silos by realigning incentives to align with business objectives.  Reduce the Global "support" roles and reconnect with the true needs of the sites.  Here's a litmus test...how long will it take for the results of this survey to be communicated back?  Months!  This is a well meaning survey, but the bureaucracy needed to conduct a relatively simple task is a illustration of the lack of agility Merck has developed.
Not continue cutting - the spin has allowed us naturally reduce overheads and the portfolio needs supporting to eek out the value but cannot be done on a shoe string budget.
Some positions require geographical location. If Covid-19 taught us anything, it's that the work can be done from any location. I'd be happy to see this reflects in the availability of all positions to all employees, regardless of their country of residence
make inclusion big...let people feel safe to speak up. Great a good place to feel supported and get developed.
Increase salary
The changes we are making right now are important, but we need more time to implement successfully.
From my point of view, the company is straightforward on this track. It is delivering our mission. However, an additional point to take into consideration is to keep investing in people´s education. To keep encouraging employees from outside the US, to keep grown professionally in the company. Perhaps some tuition fees for the employees in areas of interest for the company?
diversity and inclusion of different backgrounds and opinions.
Offer more developmental and advancement opportunities for existing employees.  Also value existing/solid experience/performance for those with a desire to advance.- rather than constantly dismissing these traits, and labeling newcomers as the top talent.  There are many deserving employees that are overlooked--not by any fault of their own. All employees want to believe that there are career advancement opportunities for everyone that has the desire to continue contributing to the success of this organization.
Continue the great work Ken Frazier did.  Be more willing to spend in some areas that will provide more benefits longer term (eg hire more support for local PC Support centers - a staff of 2-4 ppl to support 600+ people across multiple sites isn't realistic - while we make it work we'd be much more productive/efficient appropriately staffed)
Provide more support to the sales process. Provide timely information to enable team members to prepare proper business discussions with clients.
Stop changing everything and let me learn something really well. It's especially burdensome to change a process that is working, to something more complicated and that takes considerable more time.  TMF out tasking project is a huge fail in my work world. It made a simple process complicated and now I have to 'touch' the document many more times.
Continue to engage with all employees. Less D and I and more on business oriented solutions
I think in theory Merck and MSD leaders say all the right things.  They emphasize the importance of balance and taking time away....however, the work load and project timelines merely don't allow us to heed the advice of the leaders.  Bandwidth is super stretched, deliverable timelines are aggressive, and in order to meet expectations you have to work long hours.  Just saying its important isn't enough....ensuring there are ample resources and project teams are creating a culture of balance is where the difference will be felt.
HAve a global vision on terms of felxibility, not all the innitiatives apply to different countries.
Stay out of politics, stop research, be smarter in purchasing companies with med to develop
Focus on ensuring employees have a good work/life balance even with WFH; change focus away from competition and more onto collaboration; remove the bureaucratic barriers around doing work; provide scientist with adequate resources to do their non-science-based tasks including getting dedicated help staff
Merck under Ken Frazier is a place I am proud to work
1) Continue to encourage diversity,  2) be more open to challenging the status quo in the ways of doing things: try to look for solutions that enable us to innovate and foster the business with common sense compliance.. sometimes it seems we are resistant to changing the ways we have always done things.
Invest more in IT and systems that are compatible to each other as well as flexible to meet our unique needs.  This is one area that hinders us to be able to work efficiently.
Diversity and Inclusion is a focus area this year, which leads me to believe we're headed in the right direction.  While the company is diverse in number, there are few under-represented minorities in leadership positions. The responses to this survey are a better reflection of the current state versus 2 years ago.  The culture and level of support has improved.  Process development and maintenance still requires enhancement (as noted in the above responses).
I think it would be great to see increased collaboration between the divisions or at least more communication of all divisional priorities/accomplishments.
I think it was an eye-opener to management that employees can actually work-from-home and get things done. I hope that once pandemic lockdowns have been lifted, that managers do not revert back to requiring people to be on-site every day of the work week. The number of days an employee should work from home should be decided based on whether or not they need to be in the office to get their job done.
Continue to choose/explore products with the greatest promise and be quick to drop those that are not delivering as hoped. Make good decisions about our pipeline that our employees can deliver on successfully without overextending themselves.
remove the leaders who only are interested in self serving their upwards mobility.  they suppress and demotivate those of us who work towards the greater goal of improving lives.  remove the YER system.  give everyone the same bonus and raise.  aren't we all one Merck?  shouldn't we focus on achieving our collective goals rather than waste time writing accomplishments for a ratings system that puts the majority of the workforce in the same bucket?  change the review cycle to be more frequent.  it should be tightly integrated into the employer / employee discussions year round.
The silos need to go away and senior leaders need to empower the organization.  Sr leaders make decision with a fraction of the information and with silo'd data.  The devil is in the details so a decision is made that cannot be implemented.  Then there is work driven because rarely do decisions get 'undone' so the organizations re-prioritizes because that what's senior management decided.  So if you have a strong network, you can completely circumvent peers and drive decisions that are not in the best interest of the company, just by who you know.
Simplify internal processes and reporting requirement to allow more time for our core activities
I believe MSD and Merck are doing the rights things to work and deliver our mission
Continue to adapt to the rapidly changing workforce.
Faster decision-making on organizational changes. Streamline operations / focus on what's important.
We don't be diverse and included enough. In particular, we have unconscious bias for promoting younger generation and gender in Japan.
Need more transparency, unity, trust, understanding, work as a team and more laughter and fun.
Politics should be taken out of the workplace
Treat ALL employees with dignity and respect!
Publically commit to these improvements: - Break down the silos and increase cross-TA communications and processes - Implement a promotion ladder for everybody - an explicit statement of what each person needs to do in order to get promoted. This requires liberalizing the credential requirements in job descriptions so there is room to move up.  - Hold HR and the manager accountable when a high-rated colleague leaves the company. - Change our compliance-driven policies to align with industry standards. Most are more restrictive; some are less restrictive than industry standards. This attests to a body of compliance rules that is not accountable beyond the internal organization. - Recognize that our SOP's are not built for learning. Each should be accompanied by and introduced with a training slide deck.
Everything good
Determine if there is a future in local Markets or if to go central. Is there anything else besides oncology that may be what gets us into the future or are all eggs in the same basket?
Merck and MSD is doing a awesome job, Thank you.
be more customer oriented
Being a female colleague I feel ignorance sometimes as  some specific colleagues get more value . MSD is a very good house earlier but I am finding some lacking as I am here from last 10 years
Embrace modern ways of working, especially given our experiences during the pandemic. Allow employees to adopt remote working/hybrid working patterns where possible.
Listen more closely to the complaints/needs of the employees and take small steps to show support and improvements, especially during a time when the company is overly burdened by NewCo spin-off, a pandemic and need to deliver on company objectives.
There is an extremely high work load and a lot of pressure on each individual. There is little room to have an "off" day or having reduced capacity for any reason. Providing more room to breath and ensuring work-life balance for it's employees, would make MSD a better place to work with more satisfied employees, which in turn would allow us to deliver on our mission in a better way.
Do not support showing off by the team members if something is not relevant or not helpful to the process. Work on security system as I have like 5 different passwords which are changing each 3 months, can't be the same and need to be different each time. There is no official password wallet which could be used so people are stored it anyway not in safest way as it is impossible to remember. Thank you!
Continue  towards being more a bottoms up  company , ensuring the key business goals and milestones are being developed and taken ownership at people level.
Live up to the mantra of work life balance. It is stated however not practiced.
The company is doing well in my humble opinion.
I thing there are a lot of procedures that can be simplified. It is easy to add complicated procedures that lead to more complicated process and confusion within the team, but to make complicated process simple is something that we should  strive to that direction.
Investing in people
continue as we are currentlly doing
The pandemy could give the opportunity to the company to be the leader in re-defining our ways of working in terms of flexibility in time/venue (eg. possibility to choose remote/office work. Flexible working hours considering different timezones. Allow for Job sharings or other forumulas to make job done but allow some people to reduce amount of working hours)
In India every leader work in Field employees then should know the Field,what’s going on in market.But I am Field employee,I am responsible that and I always positive mindset my work. other country I don’t know the work culture.
Promote employees' ownership and set high productivity, quality and compliance standards.
Availability of more permanent or longer term temporary contracts at MSD would help to maintain resources at the level needed to achieve the targets of the company
Ensure that IT systems are aligned and transfer information from one department to another, breaking down silos here as well. To little oversight and direction, little leadership in IT, on which we all depend. The company is held together by excel sheets, manually.
Let non-essential employees work from home going forward unless there is a business need that requires them to be in person.
Local concern with employees well being from theory/speech to practice/concrete actions
Keep protecting employees, being respectful and generating commitment Keep focusing on patients and customer needs Evolve Policies to real live needs, new channels, data & analytics arena, etc Reinforce honest leaders that ensure diversity and speak up in the teams, instead of directional approach
Institute a looking after your health policy certain companies have vendors who deliver healthy lunches when your are at the office, offer vitamin supplements to employees to boost immune systems, offer sessions with a psychologist to assist with dealing with stress & home situations that might impact on work, offer staff a duvet day when you are burned out & just need a time out per quarter, give staff a day off on their birthdays. Valued employees always go the extra mile
Focus on increased credible branding/public visibility and ensuring MSD is continuing to become more visible to help people feel greater pride for working with MSD.  Review how we fund Inspire as need to move budget above 0.5%.  Increased focus on formal team building and (hopefully) post Covid in a face to face environment.  While we have made Teaming tools available we have limited and reduced facilitation of this type of development (was championed via L&D).
Listen much more carefully to any concerns from the employers
work toward simple systems - my biggest struggle is with our IT systems
More Priority and importance are given to contractors and Management happy to increase contractors then employes and Most of time all-important work is managed only in US and communication from higher management to employes is very poor , we come to know upcoming projects and other information from contractors ..  employes are very lowed compare to contractors and benifites which discourage your work
Some processes need to be simplified, i.e. approval of IT purchases, help desk.  Simple IT purchases like $200 monitors, as long as they are on the approved list, should not need approval except from manager.  The Help Desk still takes too long to solve issues and are sometimes difficult to understand or they don't understand the issue.  Purchasing and IT support always seem to be pinch points.  Sometimes resources are updated or changes occur  and are not communicated widely.
Hiring real people managers in stead of managers who only look at due dates, not at personnel and who only think about their own carrier. That will not help MSD as a company, but only themselfs. I realy like the company MSD, what we do and which product we make. Helping other people/animals with our medicines all over the world. Bad managers break down the MSD culture, where it stands for.
More emphasis on work-life balance.  All of the colleagues in my division are Type A personalities.  Highly self-motivated and highly productive.  But they are breaking down.  Our boss keeps telling us to be like the airlines:  put on your own oxygen mask first, and THEN help others.  But HE is stretched even farther than we are, and we emulate his behavior.  There are always even more projects that need to be started since we are all at home due to COVID and not traveling.  When everyone was traveling, it was easier to pare everything down to the most essential priorities.  Now it seems that the more projects the merrier, and you can't just say "no" because you are part of a team.  On top of that, our boss' boss has added high time demand trainings and strategy meetings that require months and hours of time.  Again...since we are not traveling, it is assumed that we all have an endless capacity to absorb more projects and ideas.  We don't.  "Business critical" is no longer considered
Merck and MSD is a great place to work (already). We need to continue improving our technical processes and conditions for employees.
Take care  off the colaborations
Merck and MSD must not look at the Employees w.r.t. color, but w.r.t. the work that is done.
The office resources should be available to use in this pandemic issue.
Achieve consistent leadership approach to rewarding employees. Increase value of tenured employees in financial reward and career growth opportunities.
I think the company is doing well focusing on invest in research, although it creates more budget pressure in other areas...
Incentive plan adapted to national sales
Focus big picture long term, not short term course corrections.
The only thing that the company could improve on is keeping politics out of the workplace.  There have been some presentations that tend to sway one way and that is not being inclusive.
None. Overall, company is doing well
Continue to prioritize D&I but also put these principles into place when hiring for leadership positions. Alternatively, proactively groom candidates for future roles in support of D&I initiatives when future positions are open.
Be mindful of how diversity & inclusion trainings are structured. There's a lot of subjectivity in current training, where "correct" answers are based on assumptions & not straight facts.  The training will not allow you to move forward unless you agree with an answer that is NOT the only right answer.  I'm a person of color (African American background) and I found some of the scenarios and "correct" answers in our current diversity trainings to be problematic & potentially leading to worse cultural relations because it could make people reluctant to talk to each other for fear of saying the wrong thing and being accused of a "microaggression".  We must all be reasonable and not so sensitive & offended by every "perceived" slight.  People cannot possibly be expected to know everything that each & every person we encounter is going to be triggered by or will perceive as a microaggression!  To think we can know this based on color of another's skin, is itself a stereotyping assumption.
Stop saying we value diversity of opinion, different points of view, challenging conventional wisdom,  etc. unless senior executive management is willing to cascade that culture down to the departments. I have worked in a lot of places in my life. Merck is the most “yes man” culture I’ve ever experienced.
Keep political activism out of business. Serving the world and communities with products is our mission!
My opinion is: Leadership training at all levels to manage people and work on empathy within teams.
When making a decision globally (like with QMS), the leaders have to understand the true impact to work force, ask for and act upon the feedback from the shopfloor.  Respect people's time- meetings should stay on topic (including tier) and should only be held when needed. Make the  "fluff"/additional work
Listen to the employee.
There has been almost a 100% turnover in upper leadership... it's scary and i don't think many of us know what to expect. Even in my department - there has been much discussion of an organization shift.  Between with what's going on in the world (instability) combined with heavy turnover for leadership (more instability) it is hard to feel at ease. Not that leaders are under obligation to provide transition plans or at least discuss the turnover at all but i think given the climate it would be nice to have one less thing to worry about - if possible.
Merck has made it more challenging to be successful in the field with recent changes in MMF and FFM policies.  Oncology is a completely different space than primary care and new policy tends to not look at our needs here in the oncology division.
The 2 key issues that touch all employees: TIME and MONEY Anything that touches on those 2 is a win!  People need to have time to take care of themselves, think, work well and feel like they are able to do their best job without cutting corners because of competing priorities.  AND need to feel valued.  This round of bonuses was a bit of a gut punch after a really challenging year and working harder and under more difficult circumstances than ever before.  Also it is so difficult to bring employees up to parity for the 50th percentile due to HR restrictions.  This needs to be corrected to give managers more controls over retention activities and salary adjustments.
Control the volume of projects and resources
Stay out of Politics!  Stay focused on our mission!
Continue doing what we are doing, but ensure that we are TRULY prioritizing our priorities and work because there is still too much occurring, which is burning out our employees.
Management- (Regional Managers) need to support and value their team. Reps need to feel that their manager is a safe place to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.
Like now more flexible work environment instead of mandatory on-site x no. of days.
Better assure current employees have a pathway forward.  A clearly defined career path should not need to include reinventing your role every 2 years.  It is fantastic the we have recruiting and talent acquisition teams for external clients, but the same efforts should be done for current employees.
- keep focusing on patient safety - keep supporting diversity (we can set an example for the nation) - stop focusing on ivy league graduates when hiring - be transparent on pipeline product progress (reasons to be exited)
Projects often feel under staffed, particularly in terms of people running experiments, which can lead to rushing at critical times.
Continue to provide these opportunities for the employees to provide feedback.
I think the steps Merck and MSD are taking currently do make the company a great place to work and deliver their mission.
Supervisors and team leads should have proper training to have solid infrastructure for training and development discussions. A more robust program of rotations and development plans across the global Merck / MSD network would help ensure better retention and talent growth.
-It is very important that people managers are actually managing people or know how to manage people.  -Merck has a lot of very good programs for D&I, however the people that are apart of the problem do not participant. -Not all work groups and managers are creative equal. I would recommend others to work in my group, but not some of the other groups in Merck.
Develop employees, determine what their professional goals are and work to meet them. Employees should want to stay with the company rather than feel stuck at the company.
It seems as though a myriad of authorities outside of my management chain have the right to directly demand my time.  An initiative to streamline these non-core demands and channel them through management so that they are aware of them would be helpful.  It would be interesting to know if executive management knows how much training is required of its reports.  This seems to have exploded with Covid WfH as off-site employees look for things to do.
We’ve focused too much on “diversity and inclusion”. Time to focus on business.
Keep offering flexibility and resources to employees for COVID.
Deliver on our pipeline and make sure that we outmaneuver the competition, while continue to focus on ethics and compliance.
We need to be more visible in terms of the science we are doing and showcasing to the world. Science = enables human and animal health; SCIENCE SAVES LIVES; ....
focus on the pipeline
It may not be MSD but the area where I am, which does not have correct communication and does not support its staff. There are many managers but not good leaders.  I don't even remember that it was a 1 :1
Instrumentation should be appropriately resourced so that instrument failures and prolonged downtime do not impede progress.
Focus on making processes simpler
Refrain from pushing political views onto employees unless there is a means for employees to respond without fear of retaliation in any form. In general, brining either side of the political spectrum into the workplace is a bad idea. It's evident there is a political bias in the company and it alienates those that don't share that viewpoint. This further divides the company as it's counter-productive to an inclusive workforce and does not foster a workplace that's open to fair and productive discussion.
Merck needs to focus on paying for performance. There is little incentive to be compensated past 100% of given goals and salary is not competing with other leaders in the industry. It’s a great place to get experience and leave for more money. The products were great but there is little incentive to stay with the company with their over-restrictive policies and compensation.
There are very few promotions to those that perform a good job. P2s and M1s get stuck in there roles and with the salary caps and lack of P3s in operations there is no way to retain talent and knowledge.
There needs to be clear boundaries set for WFH - it is not ok for employees to be working for greater than 40hrs/week and then have to log on during the weekends. If you are set to go on vacation there should not be an expectation that you have to work.
Stay out of politics PERIOD.
Focus on helping people through making life changing medicines.  Treat everyone with dignity and respect.  Respect that in a diverse work force people will have different views on situations and don't try to cram one viewpoint down on the company.  Perhaps focus on inclusivity rather than diversity.  Because by being inclusive you will naturally become diverse.  But focusing on diversity, does not necessarily result in inclusivity.
Within the past 9 years, company headquarter was changed from Whitehouse to Kenilworth and now to Rahway.  This is just too much and causing confusion.  It also has financial impact which can be used to award people or to improve facility.  Flex center is one of the examples that we should put more efforts to bring in new technologies.
For my case all posts need experience and how can i apply for it if i work for another department 🙁 Um so sad as i have 2 choices continue as sale or leave MSD where i belong and feel secure
I am very proud of being part of Merck. I fully respect and admire  Merck's mission and vision.  I think  Merck is already considering the next steps moving forward. One of the steps Merck should take is considering employees ideas and be open to be more innovative by utilizing unconventional approaches for drug discovery.
Have leadership better communicate timelines and stay focused on those timelines in regards to experimentation and subsequent documentation that needs to be completed. Also have better communication in general about "Merck-in-the-news" - I see developments about Merck from outside news sources before I hear about it via official company channels. Seems like a bit of a disconnect there (especially if the news has been submitted to the public via press release). I'm not suggesting that employees know before the outside world, just that, if the outside world gets a press release, maybe it should also be shared internally.
Stop being a US centric global organization and be truly global  - We tend to look through a US lens when delivering to Markets and this isnt customer centric. Once small example of this is global PRT and US PRT being the same board and, no one has worked outside the US and know s how the markets operate or what is acceptable. Being told we cant have a global built asset as it need to go through the US and be approved first is a not inclusive or diverse in thinking.  We also need about 10 people above to sign off on doing something diffrent and as soon as you get one red light its over. We talk about agility while turning like an oil tanker
Keep everyone inform and be transparent regarding all changes as a result of new board members (ideas) at Merck.
- ease processes and policies that are sometimes too much - focus on employees well-being  - foster a culture of less remote meetings: most of the days meetings occur from 8am to 6pm
career advancement should be the same for all team members
Continue to work on diversity and inclusion, have executive level as well as the lower level managers talk the talk and walk the walk.
Find a way to include more "up managing" so that decisions that are counter to efficiency and progress can be altered. I appreciate and support Ken Frazier's efforts in urging companies to oppose restrictive voting laws. A just an equitable society is a stable one. Create more incentive and awareness for employees to get involved in making the world a better place. Many new employees have no clue about Merck Gives Back programs and matching gifts. I'd appreciate the opportunity to get more than 80 hours of company matching for voluntary work.
Need to do the real "walk the talk". The speech is beautiful, but sometimes it's not applied.
Merck has handled our safety and well being extremely well throughout this pandemic. I am very grateful for that and above all that showed empathy and support for employees. The entire way we connect now has changed and I want to see flexibility with work life balance with home/office/travel and be able to make the right choices as a leader to be the best at my job and be supported in those choices. We’ve learned a lot about efficiencies and engagement and I don’t want to take two steps back and revert to our old ways. I want to see continued hybrid models evolve because there is no rationale that makes sense to return to the way we used to do business pre-pandemic.
Get people back to work. I have been on site since the beginning of the pandemic. I see a ton of people mailing it in as far as work goes. Not very motivating as a day to day employee on plant site.
Need to simplify processes, reduce the number of SOPs, have systems that are connected.  I still find it difficult to find out who I need to contact for things so you should explore ways to make it easier to find out who does what and who to contact.   It is also a very lean company and some people's responsibilities are several and so bottle necks result. I also notice that a lot of people are still working when they are on leave so I worry about their mental health and ability to switch off.
No response at this time
truly supporting the employees working from home for this long time with resources  now that we are working like this for more than a year, we do not have a home office at home, the environment is not ideal and that was not what we committed to
Continue searching for a diverse workforce made up of the brightest and smartest individuals!
Sytems need to be continuely upgraded and improved. Either old systems or new launch systems make we (both MSD colleages and collabration site staffs) confused and waste much time on waiting (ex: SIP, InForm...)
Be more flexible in hierarchy of decision making
Enforce training for people managers, be more open-minded and flexible to manage members' requirements. Managers should try to trust their members more and strengthen relationship.
Align all different site Policies in a region with regard to pay
I don't have any suggestions.
The company is supporting the best way they can, the unprecedent times that we are living are the ones that do conflict with our daily routines
accept working from home not only by way of exception
No further comments here. I am satisfied the way the company is running the business while taking care of the welfare of its people.
The decision making should be very swift.
Employed the right people for the right job.
to allow employee's to officially work from home at least 2 days per week in Ukraine as this would reduce time to get to work and make workdays less stressful and have more free time for both work and personal needs.
Paternity leave for union workers.
Work on new IT and mobile solutions to simplify our business processes.
Continue their strong encouragement of diversity and inclusion
Have no tolerance for leadership that views fear and intimidation as motivators for better performance.
I am deeply concerned we are moving backwards in terms of administrative work getting moved to us rather than allowing us to perform our job which is supposed to be strategic. We must take work out of the system.
Continue to be outspoken regarding injustices in the world - I am proud when I read/watch the news and see the company I work for speaking out.
- Be inclusive when making decision. - Avoid not telling people when there are resignation. - Avoid micro-managing, as that indicate that Management does not trust employees ability to work independently. - When hiring, the experience become focus point but once they got an experienced person. that level of experience is not recognized.  - Recognize the talent acquired and develop it even further. - Work on stuff retention, high resignation of high-skilled people on site - Invest on providing external training and improve on career development. - Refrain from showing Favoritism  - No growth opportunities in MMD, only seniors and LT get promotions. - No growth opportunities in MMD, only seniors and LT get promotions. Leadership prefer to hire externally than promote internally. - Move from controlling to empowering.
Some scientific practices and processes require modernising and streamlining, including software and databases, processes for approval. Also sticking to meetings within core hours is not adhered to, making the workplace less inclusive for e.g. parents with childcare responsibilities in the morning / evening. There is also a lot of bureaucracy for scientists which takes up often up to 50% of our time preventing us from doing our work faster / more effectively. Shipments (ordering and sending) often take up a lot of time too and delay experiments.
Be real.  Doing things for image or political correctness can stall agility and what is best for our company.
Simplify processes, automation whenever possible. Apply agile principles
Work life balance.
Increase partnership opportunities
Provide more people resources so we don't have to wear as many hats as leaders.
Value current employees and ensure they are treated with respect.  Management of our production department needs a lesson in these principals to reduce turnover and increase moral.  Overall I feel extremely valued and respected in my department/position and find it concerning individuals from other departments within the same organization don't share the same opinion.
Merck has done excellent work focusing on employees.  Living the George Merck quote of "...medicine is for the people not the profits..." by focusing on employees which will bring life saving medicine from research, to manufacturing, to supply, to promotion all are driven by great Merck employees who are here to help save lives.
Transparency, encourage people and their  ideas.  Focus on people and the numbers will come, focus on numbers and the people will leave
Increase recruitment from outside of the industry, particularly in areas like Data and Analytics and Digital Transformation where many other industries have progressed these information sciences well beyond where the pharmaceutical industry has taken them.
Offer a sabbatical to reward loyalty.
More visibility into the challenges/opportunities and long term plans for the company Increase diversity to have more voices and view points Increase employee benefits: it's not just about pay, but other types of benefits such as different types of insurance (high, med, low deductible options), HSA/HRA options in addition to FSA, increase paid family leave time, increase support for child/family care support
Listen to the employee more and provide more opportunities to move up.
In Egypt , New drug launches
Salary and wellbeing of employees specially IN countries suffers inflation .
Build and persuade development program for top talent employees  Build a speak up safe zone
1. While in the midst of working on process  standardisation, to consider as well the resources that would be require for the interim solution. 2. To centralised all the work in BSC, and agree on the BPO support globally irregardless of country/local language. 3. To continue to pursue for activity based rather than supporting by country.
To be realistic
I think we are counting on people, we have great diversity, I think we should become No 1 in few years! I would encourage to invest in people as we are doing right now and develop them for further functionally in the company.
After COVID-19 outbreak/period, Merck/MSD needs to reschedule face 2 face global/regional cross functional meetings, to reinforce our strong cross country/regional/global collaboration. Besides our mission and great products,   the people that work at MSD/ MERCK are the most important to me.
support agility in the way we work. there are a lot of protocols to follow. things are moving slowly and every process of bringing new software or equipment requires a lot of time. we need more local support with authority to approve new tools in order to be aligned with the leading companies.
keep listening and supporting employees
Focus on ensuring team members have appropriate resources to get work done effectively; work life balance is more challenging than ever since the lines between work life and home life are blurred
consider more resources to add to the team to lighten the workload
Focus more on employees well-being and reduction of stress. Also keep working on ensuring real inclusiveness across all countries with acceptance of ideas and thoughts from diverse members and continuous learning and applying of lessons learned. Explore ways to work closer between markets and global teams.
Ensure we have an appropriate number of staff to do the tasks we need to do.  Many departments are understaffed and resourcing is difficult to obtain for projects
Provide sufficient resources, simplify work and compliance process and provide a work life balance work place
MSD needs to have a stronger sense of the changes in the workforce, industry and ways of working. Talent retention  is a challenge that we face which significantly impacts operations that would deliver on the mission. Our policies while sophisticated and risk-averse in many important areas, may not be fully adaptable to the current situation of virtual ways of working.
Maintaining a flexible workplace, to help with the juggle of life. Supporting the different needs of each staff member in regards to flexibility. Last year changed the way we did things dramatically. Face to face engagement is important, but  it important to allow staff to find the right balance between f2f and remote working.
Transparency
Respect each employee and make decision of changing people's position/job according to clear rationale, not just depending on manager or HR's impression on employees
Launch medicines which could treat Covid-19 and save lives.   Get Covid-19 Vaccines to market at the earliest.
well balanced work and personal life
Ensure that managers at the Associate Director level have the resources and information available to make decisions quickly on how company changes affect their team and implement those changes quickly and appropriately. More information on career development for employees who are limited by degree requirements for progression within their department.
be more flexible and adaptive to country specific environment/situation
transparency and the management shall do what they promised
Fair paying for labor...
Connect great ideas like Transformation Office and Ways of Working to tangible outputs on broader level. Openness, information update and transparency from managers is also critical. Sometimes missing consistency during decision making.
Need to come out with more products to sustainable growth
Limit focus on headcount, but focus on cost. There is a disbalance on how easy (more expensive) consultants can be added whilst it takes an extreme amount of time (= waste) to hire one single FTE. Trust that managers make the right, balanced, decisions.  Consider the HR promotion strategy. Appreciating that jobs are banded, not people but it is extremely difficult to get talent promoted into a next role (retention risk), especially within highly specialized groups and teams requiring specific skill sets.
Reduce the volume of priorities focusing on what matters most, to protect an reasonable work/life balance during the current pandemic context
Put quality before production/money
Also give the time to rest
Investing in science in order to strenghten the pipeline
MSD is still very hierarchical. I miss feedback culture - here this is mote using the manager as the escalation point so at the end I feel challenging status quo is not existing and openness for Experimentation , Empowerment is missing. Nr of meetings without clear goal and agenda is a standard - having 14 participants when only 3 are actively speaking - is a norm which makes me sad.
Not alienate white people. As a white person I feel unwelcome in my subsidiary. All I want is to work in a non-racial environment where I feel welcome and valued for my contribution, and where nobody's race and ethnicity is more important than the job at hand and the company's mission.
to stay innovation company
Reduce planning hurdles so that there are more time to execute actual works
To create, happy, secure and safe space for employees to work
Provide better tools for working more efficiently, in particular many systems an d procedures are extremely complicated and prevent people from being productive. In addition processes are moved constantly, there are too many processes and they are difficult to find when needed. As an example, adding a new vendor takes months which is a risk to compliance and customer relations. Systems that do not work make people feel stressed and demotivated.
keep  up the  opportunity like this  to ask how we can do things better,  small steps all add up
By making their employees feel appreciated by giving them incentives
Electronic batch record, automation of repetitive work circumstances, Long term commitment and stability balanced with short term opportunities.
MSD has for the most part very committed and hard working teams and team spirit and collaboration has been so important and evidenced over the last year.  The activity / resources required to deliver upon expectations isn't always fully understood and while commitment to deliver has not wavered, the environment is becoming more pressurised given the effort and pace required to meet the expectations. Remote working is now implemented and the efforts needed to do the day job could be better supported in a remote setting for all colleagues longer term. MSD need to simplify and consider policies that support a remote environment, reduce email traffic, reduce the time on calls per day and support and lead out on policies that give time to thinking and getting through activity.
Create the conditions that will allow our employees to have a fair day's work. The company sends excellent messages about mental health, time management, work/life balance, but is reluctant to provide the staffing levels or simplified systems that can make those things a reality for a lot of people.
Free to speak up on every Merck and MSD site, being critical identifying where this is not the case and act on it to improve.
To protect and preserve employees, make NewCo separation less painful, less stress.
1. Provide better professional growth for employees. COVID Situation is hard, we are all suffering from it but the lack of professional growth options is demoralizing.  2.Extend Work from Abroad program. As an expat, the current situation really hard being unable to see family. We have been working from home almost a year now, being able to work from our country home for a longer period would have made no difference for almost all job positions. I believe MSD Employees have demonstrated that border should no longer be a limitation to fulfill our roles.     3.Rollback decision to take out GIFs from Teams. This actions feels like censorship for me. The justification for said action was that some images were identified as stereotypes and racism, however it is a minority of images. If we follow that same logic, should facebook or other social media be banned as well for having stereotype and racist content?
Value all of it's staff- regardless of their level. Really listen to staff and deal with issues.
Consult customers more comprehensively about any policies or process that directly affect them.
stay a stabile company with a clear future.
Listen to the ground floor. If only asked, all operators could give a multitude of tiny issues that seem never to be resolved which would make life easier, RFT better and production numbers increased
-Reduce significantly the time consuming bureaucracy often linked to implementation of compliance policies. 2 concrete examples: simplify the cumbersome and ever changing procedure for shipments (lack of alignment between GTC and AHTC results in unclear guidelines), simplify the procedure for implementation of SDLC on PCs connected to instruments.  - Improve onboarding of new employees by having a site-specific "handbook" with relevant rules (working hours, vacation, sick leaves, etc...), the current system with info spread on sync is not convenient to use/navigate into. Such handbook (pdf) gathering in one place relevant info would also be useful for "old" employees. - Invest more resources on development of new vaccine and drugs technological platforms across target species (for instance: nucleic acid based vaccines) to ensure that our future products are in line with the market needs (see for example the Covid19 vaccines situation and where we are (not) now in that market...)
Continuing in this great environment
take care of its workforce like many other companies have done specially during the pandemic -- take a page out of Google playbook.
Take seriously the approaches from 'Ways of Working', I mostly see these being used in presentations/priorities, etc. but no real actions across the companies. If we could really break the silos and work as a global team, not hiding information just because of job security concerns.
allow people with a lower education to get promotions based on work experience and accomplishments
Further lean into innovation e.g. new go to market models, partnerships with digital health providers.  Be ambitious with a "post-Organon" vision for Merck.  Accelerate bold BD moves to augment the pipeline.
Help to communicate how different global initiatives should be prioritized across division and at site.
There is often an imbalance observed between work and home life especially with work from home. There is too much work to be done per person which results in stress and workers missing out on ensuring their personal lives are an equal focus.
They don't listen to older/senior employees so why bother.
Current state is that people actually can't take vacation (except for very end of the year). There is no such thing as coverage or delegation in MMD. When you leave for your own purposes, you leave a hole. If you ever left for more than a few days, you will suffer at year end. Leaders and people managers do not make it safe to take substantial time for yourself. In the past, you could arrange for coverage. In the past, you could work ahead, and play catch up. Now, we are so lean and working so many hours, this is not possible,
Balance the inevitable synergies with the need of maintaining sufficient workpower to deliver adding value activities - transform before reducing!
I think that Merck should evaluate the business process systems and look for ways to streamline them. The systems are so complicated and "bulky" that we spend too much time trying to figure out how to do things and who does what instead of focusing on the higher level activities in our area of expertise. We also have so many hands on projects that we lose transparency on the big picture.
Continue to invest in personal development. More opportunities to get involved in leadership programs. Additionally, continue to develop in technology and IT solutions. Make it easier for employees to have access to IT professionals to assist with troubleshooting.
When we had our national virtual conference and Merck only sent two gift items and other companies were sending several boxes of gift items it was a little disappointing since Merck was saving so much money on hotel and food and it seemed underwhelming (same gifts if we had been there in person). Sometimes it’s the little things.  Also other companies are luring others away with bigger financial incentives and if Merck wants to be a leading oncology company, they need to match the benefits of the other companies.  Otherwise I would say that for a big company Merck does an excellent job from top down of being supportive and in the know and wanting to do what is right within the current political context and global happenings.  I felt so supported during the pandemic and felt Merck did the right things on a personal level and financial level to feel that my job wasn’t at stake and to balance home and work duties.  Thank you so much for that!!
Please launch new and more molecules in India.
Continue with employee briefings
Overall Merck is an excellent place to work and I am proud to be a sales representative for this company.  I also appreciated the $1000 grant as an incentive and owner of Merck  that was given all employees 3 years ago. This gift did remind me that Stock Options were part of the compensation package at the Sales level a number of years ago.  One suggestion I have  especially now that the company and sales force is significantly smaller is to include Stock options  again as part of the compensation package for representatives that exceed plan. I think this would be a great way to continue to motivate the Sales Force to think like an owner and provide  additional incentive  for employees who have chosen to stay in sales.
Support staff so they can work reasonable hours.
I think the connection between mission and financial realities (esp. bottom line) are abstract concepts to everyone, so  connecting the dots or messaging is helpful to keep employees engaged and committed.
Acknowledge the actual achievements and promote based on them rather than encourage people to switch to other groups/departments to get a "promotion"
MSD Argentina in many regards does not look like Merck/MSD from the rest of the world, I feel it is still "an Argentinian company" in a negative aspect.
so much change this year, Ken and Mike leaving. New CEO, new role for Caroline, new role for Frank, Riad leaving.  We need a town hall to define the future and settle the nerves of the company. Budget cuts, downsizing and the new leadership has created a swirl of uncertainty.
You need to have managers actually follow what they read off a piece of paper.  In a Team Staff meeting they preach inclusive, promotions, growth, etc.....but then during 1:1's the exact opposite is told, that "we need to say those things but not follow them"
I think we are OVER emphasizing the diversity/inclusion focus because of political reasons.  When you added it to my performance evaluation, you've now over reached in my opinion.  Inclusion and diversity-It is important, and valued from me.  Settle down a bit-it feels like you are shoving it down my throat.
Look at what the competition are doing - how can we differentiate ourselves, how can we challenge the current pharma ways of working with external stakeholders to ensure we are the partner of choice
Provide resources for mangers that are working in their position without having previous people managing skills. Sometimes employees are promoted to a manager position because they are an excellent performer but they lack the necessary people management skills needed for the position.
Allow the Wilson site, specifically the laboratory,  to utilize the summer working hours that are recognized by other Merck sites. This helps add mental stability to individuals that work in a faced paced environment and allows for more work/life balance among individuals.  Additionally, continue to allow the individuals working from home to do so if they desire. This limits the number of individuals at the sites.
Offer competitive work-life balances. Merck is behind on some of the benefits other companies offer in terms of chidl care, WFH, and other work-life balances
Continue to treat all people with respect and equal pay for both men and women.
Ensure work life balance for the employees .
Continue to invest in their employees. Provide opportunities for tenured employees. We need to make sure our tenured employees have opportunity for upward promotions.
Need to better define strategy and growth plans. Recent focus is all on cost cutting and finances and not mission.
Continue to speak up on social issues; I am proud to work for a company whose CEO is not silent on injustices that affect our colleagues.
I am very concerned because I feel Merck has made a political stance. I also feel the D&I initiative may have created more caution in speaking up and out rather then open dialogue  I will not speak out for fear of being misunderstood or not expressing the right political stance. I feel people I work with are “more” sensitive to comments and conversations more than ever before in the time I have worked for Merck
Make work from home standard for those that are not essential to be present to manufacture product. Expand the flexibility to work from home. I am extremely more efficient working from home than driving to the site. Continue to foster an inclusive work environment, reinforce the 12 inclusive behaviors.
COVID programs have shown what is possible with focus, prioritization  and extreme collaboration in clinical development.  Cross-functional resources should be allocated to leverage those best practices where they can be more broadly applicable.   Whereas it seems the priority since the decisions has been to just decrease head count ASAP.
Continue to focus on employees, patients, and customers.
Company expectations should align with workload.  We strive for monitoring excellence and inspection readiness which is nearly impossible with the workload I have.
Continue to have all of the assistance programs available.
New drug Pipeline to maintain stable operation and growth
Paths to career development need to be more transparent. I agree it should be employee led, but often employees can’t see all available paths and resources. It feels like select employees are pulled forward, while the others must fend for themselves.
Better technology and systems
To organize the period for the implementation of different global initiatives for the countries to have the chance to have an better organization.
"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear." - George Merck I feel our company must be reminded of this quote. Every decision that's made involves the financial aspect. When quality decisions are made, even though they may meet the minimum regulatory requirements, money and cost is still a factor that's brought up in every discussion. We are also focused on short term gains even if they result in long term losses. Sometimes gains do not always translate directly to dollars; it translates to a better working environment, increased morale, a motivated workforce, and increased compliance which is invaluable and this should be OK!  Understand that digital does not always equal faster or less work. Recognize that transformation requires time and heavy change management. Lead by example. Practice what our company policies state that we practice.
Reimagine the way we reward our employees. Our AIP system is not aligned with nor supportive to ways of working.
Quit with the politics...everyone has different perspectives and views.
Hold managers accountable to be better managers for their people and not just the bottom line. Make them walk the talk around DEI work and not just be figureheads.
Continue to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.
Continue with the Unconditional theme so that we can embrace diversity and inclusion.
Need better alignment on objectives and culture between Commercial teams and shared services (e.g., PRT, IT Capabilities).
I very much have felt supported over this difficult year.  I applaud and value the resources that Merck has extended to their employees.  Thank you
Continue to find more competitive ways for 15 year employees and increase benefits.  Not needing a degree wont help pay increase for sure.
Not only listen but take action on feedback from eomployees.
Enable work - life balance
Continue to speak out about injustice.  Continue to foster a diverse and inclusive work environment.  Continue to recognize how hard Merck employees work.  Continue to put our patients first.  Continue to have our senior leadership be more visible and approachable.
Reduce the degree of freedom at which decision-making democratized across the business. Not everybody should be decision makers
Stream line number of people involved in achieving goals, more lean in getting job down,  Allocate appropriate SME to get full pictures of situation
Don’t lose sight of our core mission....saving and improving the lives of the patients we serve.  That’s where we can have the most impact in this world.  Secondly empower our people to do that.  We have lost that vision in the last 12 months.  Sales and compliance need to work together to create the best environment for our customers.  We are currently operating as 2 separate companies.
Improve work/life balance
We know Pharma is notorious for making changes. Job security is number one priority for me especially now.  I just would like that the company continues to let us know as things change with a lot of notice. We know changes are coming to the sales force.  I just need to know no matter what I have a job
Work on building a post-COVID culture where teamwork is appreciated, where people can feel comfortable to come on-site and stay on-site to make connections again with their co-workers.  I feel employees have gotten used to working from home and not having to commute every day; some don't want to have to go on-site.  But, we do need some on-site work even for those employees that can work from home full time.  Everyone is isolated and thinking only of their own tasks versus work that is not specifically assigned that keeps the group running smoothly (example organizing lab space, helping each other with physical, mental, and emotional tasks, and enabling having creative impromptu discussions in person).
This workplace is great, although the hands-on training process could be sped up slightly.
Would love to see us get more aggressive in the space regarding new vaccine technologies.  I also hope that Ken Frazier sticks around for a whole .  He truly makes me uniquely proud to work for Merck; he is such an inspiration!
to simplify the process and have more direct responsibility might help reduce errors
Stop saying that Merck thinks diversity, inclusion, courage, candor, etc. are important when truly it all depends on your management's point of view.   It rings as empty rhetoric.  I find it a waste time since I do not feel my management actually believes in it.  It makes me very angry and the company loses credibility.
Provide work/life balance.  In recent years, we have gotten more resources, but even more middle management has been hired that comes up with initiatives that are beyond what our resources are able to handle.  There is so much miscommunication among the many different people and groups that are "managing" that true feedback of how things are going is not making it back up the chain.
1. Motivate and retain top talent that have joined Merck from externally 2. Invest and reward top talent 3. Be open to new ideas and processes
Scan the industry and see what other leading companies are doing to stay successful. We seem to do it periodically to ensure our financial compensation is comparable. But I do not believe that we always match up effectively with other parameters (resources , technology and perks) to keep the sales force competitive and smiling on a daily basis.  Also our medical education department needs to be revamped. In some ways we are living in the past. The RMDs are fabulous and have tremendous impact with our customers. However our MMF, PDG, eMFs are outdated and have limited impact.  Field sales spends an incredible amount of time planning and processing programs that have limited outreach or success. Also, there is a tremendous amount of time and stress involved with conducting all of them and so many things need to be improved upon.
Do only look at cost as the main driver, invest in the future on facility and people, the well being of the employees is important as people are our key assets, we cannot afford to keep cutting resource and doing more with less.
more vacation and job sharing roles
More emphasis on the work life balance.  Can result in a negative environment in the department.  Some groups are over stretched and more balance approach on resources in different departments may be required.
pay particular attention to administrative resources
Focus on R&D and bringing new products to the market that address patient needs
Even we promote transparency, fairness, equality this does not happen. For example when it comes about new opportunities/ new roles in the organization, sometimes we don`t have the chance to see them.. neither to apply for them.
We need quality personnel in operations, the contractor experiment, always training people, and once we have people trained up, they are either hired, and moved to a different building/department/shift, etc.  Then we have to start training all over again.
Our company seems to concentrate on what field sales cant do (compliance) vs what we can do. We simply are NOT on a level playing field with our competitors.
We need to become a leaner organisation and I am not talking about the number of employees but the processes and bureaucracy. Appreciate the need especially as a giant multinational but I believe there is still a big potential to become a more agile organisation.
improve medical benefits - high deductibles and out of pocket costs
Provide more areas for expression of our interest and needs in work. Find a way to strengthen the employees' sens of loyalty to the company and brand. Take care of integration of employees within departments. Ensure that employees are proud to work in our company.
Start by enforcing social distancing in operations spaces and provide suitable work spaces for those who have to report to site every day. Due to social distancing, I cannot work at my desk and I need to hop from touchdown space to touchdown space each day. Also a shortage of usable space drives me to work out of other buildings and I need to walk across the WP site to get to my area multiple times a day.
With the Covid restrictions, a number of people are now working from home. We need to look at how this can continue. Working from home was not actively encouraged prior to Covid but there are a number of benefits to it. There should be a grant provided to people working from home to allow setting up a home office.
opportunities to learn and personal growth
More training
Continue to enhance training and training offerings to employees.
Seguir formentando New Ways of Working
never going to be a leading oncology company when we aren't at parity with other oncology companies with policies
Continue increasing diversity and inclusion efforts, not just because of the business benefits but because it is moral and ethical thing to do. Listen to employees; don't speak for them - ask them for their opinions and their perspectives on how the company's D&I initiatives are actually coming across and what we can do better. Compensate employees for all the additional hard work required to work completely from home. We were able to successfully operate in 2020 given all the COVID related obstacles, but we received reduced bonuses.
We need to get to know who we are as a company, as well as, our new leadership post spin (ie Rob Davis and new leaders across the company.)  We need to recognize that digital isn't going to take the place of all of the good people in this company.
There's a lot of talk about needing to take care of ourselves but that's accompanied with more work/demands and pressure to reduce costs.  Overtures about caring about employees come across as disingenuous and not at all connected with the reality 'on the ground'.  As they say, talk is cheap.  In Finance, there is no real effort to take work out of the system or accept 'good enough' standards instead of perfection.  It is not sustainable to expect perfection 100% of the time and in every situation.
When employees are required to meet near impossible schedules for high priority projects, the company should offer to buy back vacation when the project schedule cannot be met if employees all take their vacation time.
It would be great if Merck could support and encourage all employees to help take on vaccine hesitancy and disinformation.  The company does this at a high level, but if there were more resources and support for individuals to be able to disseminate at the local level (PTO, preschool, school boards) where much of the misinformation thrives, it could be very powerful.  A more grassroots level where a mom could here from another mom that she already knows, can have some impact that wouldn't come from national ads.
Treat everyone the same
Continue to be patient-centric, while really taking care of its employees and retaining talent, especially affording the African American and Latino employees with opportunities for advancement
Be more flexible and more innovative for early discovery projects
strong pipeline and more diversity at the leadership level.
Look to gather more details from the Grass Roots to assist in the future direction of the company
Be more proactive and timely to market events.  We take tooooooo long
I think it is pivotal to spread the Psychological Safety culture, but in a way that it truly directs how we relate with each other. It has to impact behavior, otherwise it would be cultural theater. We need to address internal politics which usually drains out so much energy in the corporate environment. This is a great company to work at, but we have room to improve in those aspects.
focus more on medicine and less on social justice issues. This is a workplace and issues involving the worlds problems do not belong. Also if there is going to be a focus on segregating all workers by categories there are some major categories that are prominently missing. I feel that there was a very positive atmosphere until the company started segregating its workers. Now I feel nothing but tension. at the few meeting I attended I got the feeling people only are going along to either get ahead or they are forced to comply with this new agenda.
Adapt quickly to this new environment and offer options to work from home, at the office and a hybrid model. Better support home office needs and tools.  Preserve employee's benefits. Drive innovation beyond product development (Digital transformation) Customer centricity
Less bureaucracy eg fewer governance bodies, less admin eg audits, compliance, HSE, faster speed all round, alignment improvements MAH and MAHI
Looking other companies at the island in order to make the necessary adjustments for the LPO site to be more competitive.
move away from paperwork and digitalize lots of things. Avoid redundancy and repetition.
I don't always feel I receive adequate training.  There have been several times I've been told to do something such as write a protocol and perform temperature monitoring and I've never received any training on that.  I did receive training once from a colleague who wanted me to fail.  Most of the time I've received adequate training but other times no training at all and just expected "to know what to do".  Or when learning something new.  I might be training with someone who does not want me to succeed.
Merck should continue to diversify its focus and product portfolio to fulfill unmet needs in the healthcare market to set the company apart in a business where access to providers is becoming increasingly more difficult.
Truly embrace WoW and provide resources necessary to implement necessary changes
Continue to offer personal development and maintain strong divisions like Oncology,Hospital Division and A strong pipeline will help our mission thrive.
Take a deep dive  to see if we have the right people with the proper knowledge , right skills
Line management is poor at Merck. The line managers are not able to support with many tasks like for example find back-up when an employee take vacations. This task has to be compelted by us, which is stressful and does not seem prefesional. we do not know what are the workload of out colleagues and we shouldn´t go around asking thsi as a favor, it shoudl be the Line manager doign this task. Unfortunatelly line managers have many other tasks as priority instead of reasources, and I am surprised that they do nto think that this shoudl be part of their hob, for me this is quite odd. I woudl like an improvement to have the line managers more focus on the resources instead of other priorities, this will help a lot to have a better understanding of the workload of the resources, since there is a high overload lately and resolution to that is taking too long. Another thing to improve is the salary, we are always in the lower bar. Diversity and the good enviroment is getting better every year
inclusion to every level colleagues and ensure their voice are heard in a safe environment
Focus on work - life balance for every individuals
Need experience sharing from successful regions.
We have a number of great initiatives implemented at other sites - the company would benefit from standardising the way each site operates to ensure we support the Brand and thus ensure the same quality and customer delivery no Matter which site you work at. As a company, we could do much better at solving problems more efficiently by mandating specific strategies and systems instead of each site trying to create their own solutions which may not be sustainable in the long run and does not support succession of people and technology
Better work life balance. ie. flexi time, shift, to enable child care at home
Develop and give growth opportunities to internal experienced employees
Rethink if it wouldn't be interesting to shift from a mechanistic structure into an organic structure.
Keep up the good work! There is a lot going on outside of my work life at the moment and my manager and colleagues are supporting me. It's a stressful time and I'm grateful to be working for a company that recognises work/life balance and has flexibility.
Deeper dive in dept's attrition rates for P4s and Merck plans to address. Currently, it's not being addressed and causing work to be redistributed at the last moment and disruption on teams and personal lives
I love this company, love my team, and have never felt better.  The company could always benefit from constant training of leaders to teach them to be dynamic, empathetic, and supportive. Leaders don't have to be the smartest person in the room but the sure need to be the able to lift up, hire, empower, and unite those that they hire.
When rolling out the companies objectives sometimes specific examples will assist managers with being able to relate them to lower level employees so they can understand. Be competitive with salaries while also properly adjusting those already within the company.
MSD has invented many good drug for patient
Concerned most about work life balance
Understand and respect work life balance. Leadership priorities are based on product supply and the team's mental health is not taken into consideration. Teams are currently overworked with no additional resources.
It is a great place to work. Leadership needs to hold functional leaders accountable for scope creep that is the biggest driver of resource consumption in unexpected ways.
Clearly communicate anticipated changes coming with the turnover in leadership.
Merck needs to be competitive in terms of wages and benefits. Leaders also need to walk the talk. There is a lot of discussion of being a data driven organization, however it is not always clear that employees that consistently exhibit strength in these areas are valued by Senior Leaders.
Identification and retention of high value employees would further support the goals of delivering on our mission.
Work with individuals to understand their concerned rather than putting one rule for all
Need a genuine focus on work life balance for colleagues.
Post pandemic, allow employees the flexibility/balance to continue to remote work and/or in person. A balance between both is necessary vs. the pre pandemic state of full in person. There is also a need to bring back company culture derived from in office atmosphere.  The people interaction is a benefit to well being.
Ask Leaders to stop making social and political statements that do not pertain to the business.  I would also like to  see defined paths for promotions/advancement
Use of playbooks and cross network ways of doing things to take advantage of hard work done previously and build/iterate on what's come before.
There seems to be a lot of policies and procedures that create unnecessary hurdles to significantly change the way we work and improve efficiency. Also work towards to more in-line promotion to minimize turn over.
Invest in Work life balance for employees, maybe Childcare support.
Continue to allow flexibility in terms of remote work where it can be done.   Continue to provide employees resources on the current events happening nationally and internationally (i.e. Covid updates, Social Injustice platforms).   Provide job security.
More simplification on processes and more focus on serving external customers rather than internal customers
Do not freeze head count because the people who stayed will have to suck up the extra work
Continue to discover New Drugs to help the world to be a better place.
Address the needs and aspirations of the next generation talent, to stay competitive and make Merck the place to be.
All are going in right way
Do more collaboration with external partners; Do more for Colleagues' welfare
Organisation should look into becoming more dynamic- Senior leaders should be assessed on their competency- Decisions should be taken faster.
Complete work from home. No Self Declaration.
Launch of new  products
getting the right people, find a pragmatic approach looking at product impact, interpreted the now guidelines in the best way
Hitting the metrics seems to be the main goal in MSD. When a goal is achieved the leads might say a 'thank you' however, they seem to be detached from day to day work and the amount stress and in some cases the 'aggressiveness' some had to tolerate to hit the metrics.
Transparency to people, about future plan, new launching and strengthening current portfolio
To Follow the ethics and integrity.
Equal grow opportunities, less middle managers, reduce the matrix reporting (I'm reporting at least to 4 people in different countries), more education budget, better salaries to attract more talent and more objective performance assessment (so far it seems it's based or likeability or affinity to the managers, and not the actual work or impact).
The managers should be more open to individual ideas and not create an atmosphere of fear to speak up.
Support resource in real practice perspective
Development plan. There is no career path to develop and contribute is different manages roles
Help people understand how they will be able to balance family and work as we start to re-engage in our post-Covid communities and re-enter our workplaces. What is the evolved employee experience we need to consider and create?
I think Merck, as a leading biotech pharma, could be more involved in the global fight against coronavirus.  The virus is unfortunately here and it will remain for some time
quite honestly, more of the same. the disruption of NewCo has now settled.  I think continuing the transformation journey now is more important than ever.
Be more in tune with the companies that they acquire and how these businesses operate so as to ensure that they have everything they need from the get go
Before running new projects carefully evaluate ROI, and human and financial resources.
Resources need to be put in place before rolling out new Procedures/Policies that require changes in how we do our work.
Review pay so that people don't get stuck at the bottom of a band forever and can see their pay moving within the band rather than always staying at the bottom.  more freedom to make the hours of work suit without requiring people to attend late meetings
- transparency how Merck / MSD will look like after Spin off organizational wise and what steps we are taking and when  - create that sense of belonging within the "new company" and teams (after such a long time working from home) . How I do not have the answer but it feel this is important to develop a plan - provide the resources to look for BD opportunities to strengthen our pipeline / portfolio and continue to share successes
Strengthen the current market technology skills of the employees and create a TEST LAB to practice those learnt skills and be ready for the new challenges during platform migration or upgrades.  Look into future and adopt the new technologies in and retire the older.
more team involvement and digital technology improvement
Make process more simple
Come up with a better training platform for job specific roles.
make sure what is agreed globally is passed down and implemented in local market
If I knew that, I would know everything
Better training programs, more flexible schedules
Align global and local initiatives closer i.e. more visibility on global initiatives so we can avoid duplication.  Clearer remit on EBRG's and initiatives such as D&I to reduce overlap of speakers, topics, etc.
more 1:1 communications with managers in these times, more development opportunities like mentorship and  leadership programs could be a good space for leveraging work motivation these days
I think the focus on diversity and inclusion is a great step forward. Making sure these efforts are maintained and supported long term will be important to Merck's future.
Talent retention should be a priority.  If we have an individual who is doing a job function entirely alone but doesn't have the years of experience to be promoted in a job description, HR should not block them from being able to be promoted.
The excellent experience I have in my current team was not always the experience I had working in MSD. Working in a previous team was like working in a different company and was not a pleasant experience. We need keep cultural and behavioral consistencies across all our teams, function and, especially, our managers across the company.
Especially during the pandemic and a heavy inspection year, evaluation of priorities should be re-assessed at WP. Across work areas (LQA, LO, and support groups) are all stretched to the maximum. Everyone is trying their best, but with the run the business work, process improvements and V599 prep/feasibility, it's a lot of competing priorities with understood (and accepted importance).
Ensure that work-life balance is maintained by having the right people in the right jobs. Do not rely only on your out performers to do all the work. Instead, create a company of outperformers to share the workload.
I think we should be less conservative, both when it comes to the way we approach new drug development and manufacturing, and also in how we speak up when it comes to the injustice we see in society.
I trust the company is doing its best to shape our future as the leaders in our segment. The new normal is still punching us, there's still a lot of changes we need to adapt to until we can say we are able to deliver on our mission at its best possible way. We need to stay focused on what matters most: our people. The amount of hours we are spending in front a computer screen it's taking its toll and we need to find a way to be more productive and stay healthy at the same time. I know we have a lot of different resources available to mitigate that, but sometimes it's no so easy to identify/get access to those resources.
The Company is doing a stellar job in encouraging, growing and accelerating young talent and young people generally.   May be they could also recognise the contributions to the company of the older and more experienced people working in the lower echelons of the hierarchy - this group can feel overlooked, ignored and sidelined.
Continue to provide emails about return to work i n the US, continue to provide transparent updates about the company's transitions (new CEO, new EVPs) and future goals.
Go back to offering the employees stock options.  It increases commitment and engagement.
Be more nimble and open to implementing new ideas and changes. There is a lot of sharing but not much doing when it comes to ideas. The amount of overlapping roles and function of commercial and medical affairs teams in HQ nd the Field creates inefficiencies, stress, and confusion. There needs to be a clear understanding from the leadership level of how these roles play out since teams keep being built (especially in Oncology) and with each team wanting to show value, there are unnecessary redundancies that are not seen in other companies.
MSD India should timely  launch new products(e.g-Bridion,gardasil-9,zarbaxa ,) as per market demand and also take approvals from local authority for new indications for already existing products (e.g. Keytruda-only two indications approved till date)
The large initiatives are sometimes difficult to understand.  While I think we get a lot of communication about initiatives like IPI and Expedition 25, I still find it difficult to understand what those projects mean for my work, how I can contribute to their success, and what they mean as a whole.
Continue to tie the work people do the impact Merck has on the World.
Future flexible shift work hours (10 hours instead of 12 hours?)
Consider revision in HR hiring practices to ensure we get the best people and that we can continue to set the bar high for our workforce. When we pay at a lower percentile than our competitors, we spend a lot of money training and hiring the consistent flow of people in and out. We would be better served with a more experienced and talented workforce and to be competitive with other companies with pay.
Continue to build our company's diversity which helps us think differently about opportunities or how to address threats in the market.  I believe in what Merck is doing and it will make us stronger.  I would also encourage Merck to continue being the company that does things the right way but we may need to evaluate how competitors are approaching things and are we being to risk averse.
Help to manage work/life balance and continue to try and reward people in other ways especially in times where morale is lower because performance is not as high and stress is high.
MSD is a company where you feel well supervised and there is an atmosphere of trust and wellbeing, all criteria are so that we can work well and increase the turnover of the company
I just recently switched jobs and I feel as though the leadership in my new position is 100x better than my old position. I think Merck still has many leaders that micromanage the business and don't utilize ways of working. I continue to see these individuals rise in the ranks at Merck and it's very unsettling that leadership continues to promote people who don't demonstrate the core values that Merck preaches.
Work on carrier development.
Company-wide initiative to block out time that we should avoid having meetings during such as lunchtime. Make summer hours be ALL year long.
I think manager training and more defined portfolio management in teams and subteams will help groups succeed. Objectives should feed into a book a work, which feeds into priorities and then day to day scheduling so company goals are tied to individual tasks. The communication and cataloguing of book of work items and their ownership is not well communicated in every team. I think this requires some additional manager training and PPM resources to ensure strong business continuity when transitioning from start up to steady-state.
Develop better the managers to give feedback, create a clear carrier plan. Focus more in colaborators mental health.
Easier ways of giving opportunities to the people, sometimes can be confusing
Maybe be more adaptive and allow people to work remotely and not be penalised for not living on territory, including living in the devolved nations.
Establish HR policy which requires 6 core hours a day to support business functions and allows flex time the other 2 required hours.
Merck needs to have competitive pay.  They say they keep up with the market but it’s obvious they are not looking at the pharmaceutical market.  So many people come and go because they get better pay elsewhere.
listen to suggestions and potential enhancements to processes and be flexible when applicable
Uncomplicated processes and logistics, it’s still difficult to get things done at Merck, takes too long to find information, our websites are too convoluted and layered, too many different websites, place information on one system and one page, our customer data base and our expense system is too layered, non intuitive, difficult to get the work done...waste a tremendous amount of time, creates frustration
I want to talk to my boss and senior on even ground as  a human.
1. Simplify processes 2. Challenge "status quo" and have "outside-in" perspective (i.e. look at what are industries are doing to make them a great place to work") 3. Leaders and managers realize the importance of their role in engaging their people and team vs managing people like a "check the box" exercise.
Company has taken proactive steps to ensure employees' safety is taken care of. I appreciate Company giving flexibility to employees in the work arrangement. One area Company can look at is the medical and insurance policies for employees and family. I find the medical protection coverage for family can be further improved. This is important especially when medical costs have risen over the years.
We should be having strong pipeline products to take care of the LOE of Sitagliptin
New products in India
Introducing new innovative Brands and product which is now missing from Human Health part. The future of Merck and MSD is depending huge on New Product especially in cardio Metabolic Division, we see nothing coming up from several years.
Improve on-boarding.  Because of Covid, virtual on-boarding was not very informative.  I've had to ask so many questions of everyone that I'm starting to feel like an idiot!
Encourage even more open collaboration between the different sites within the network and with our global groups
Sponsor full GYM Membership / Sport Activities to support an active healthy workforce.
There should be more new products added in our portfolio
For personnel WFH - provisions to allow for equipment for an ergonomic work set up e.g. an office chair.  Allow flexible working arrangements and continued options to WFH  Introduce the option to purchase annual leave days and opportunities for leave of absence rather than people feeling they have to leave if they want to for example take time out to travel.  More emphasis on furthering education and providing opportunities to people who wish to do so
Continue to be as corporately transparent as possible.  Also, remember that diversity and inclusion should be thought of for everyone and every department from the EVP to the Associate I.
I would like to see greater emphasis and early career training. I think more active development of employees and skillsets would be helpful. Additionally, I would be interested in getting the bigger picture (that is, how do the different divisions at Merck synergize together for a common purpose). It can be difficult to get a view above the group or division level. Finally, I think deemphasizing political and sociopolitical activism and focusing on scientific research and operational excellence would be beneficial.
Continue to be open about challenges that lay ahead and how it will impact different workplace teams (sales, marketing, mrl...)
Increase remote work availability.  Increased interaction between divisions to increase understanding of Merck's overall work
Merck is a great place to work.  However, since the beginning of 2021, I have seen a shift in the way Merck is conducting their business.  The sales force has had more restrictions in the way they are allowed to interact with customers (RAT tool, programs, 12/HCP/year FFM) and their copromote teams (Eisai and AZ).  Merck should be allowed to attend their programs to learn and engage with providers.  At a minimum, Merck should be allowed to meet and greet at their programs.  The RAT tool needs to go away and let the representatives use common sense with their customers.  Several companies have no restrictions and are getting access.  In addition, there should not be a rule limiting our interactions with customers.  In oncology, with that 12/HCP/year rule (Merck wide), please consider that most oncology teams are made up of 6-7 representatives.  As a result, each rep is limited to 1-2 appointments per year with a provider.  Merck should not be limiting our access more.  Thank you.
Work/life balance is important at the company-level, but at the project-level the schedules are tight and unmoveable, and this requires alot of extra hours to be put it, and this detracts from the work/life balance.  This can be managed short-term but when it becomes long term the stress is unmanageable.
Coherence
Hold management accountable for psychological safety in the workplace.
Implementing simplification by true mean to reduce workload.
I don't know if this is too infeasible of a request, but I don't think the company values the opinions of people at lower levels when making plans.  My department is experiencing tremendous strain due to demands coming from above.  If it's what we need to do, we'll try our darndest to do it.  Upper management doesn't seem to care about that though.  They're telling us what they want but not doing anything to help us.  The way it's received is, "Here's what I want, so just do it."
I feel this is a great company to work with
Take more risks. "It's now how we've done it before" should be done away with as should the perceived preference to be a fast follower as opposed to on the cutting edge of biology. Reduce the layers of management and pseudo-management to streamline discussions as well as the decision and approval process.  If science is truly the priority, than those who design, execute, and interpret the experiments need to be rewarded for their efforts and the company culture should shift to prioritize these efforts as opposed to making ppt's and attending meetings where others give ppt's.
The future of this company is closing in the next year. It is nothing that is necessary for this site.
Act according to Market. SOP’S and working with stringent guidelines and discipline is required but it shouldn’t be like this that you can’t even able work in the market. Flexibility as per market needs should be there and that only will help to survive in the market. Theory which we read in the books seems good but actually when go to real ground situation you have to modify the theory to get the desired results. Organisation is becoming so very theoretical and very very impractical. The expectations are to much from field staff without providing the required support and resources.
Equality among all people
It has been a tremendous assistance having work flexibility and child care support. I would hope to see Merck continue to provide backup care assistance similar to 2020.
Encourage innovation, reward risk-taking
Regularly revisit compensation and career progression. Employees are not compensated at market rates. There is very little room for promotion. Unlike MRL, employees don't have in-role promotions and when talent from outside is brought, it does not help the morale. We have difficulty attracting and retaining talent.
Establish clear goals expressed in clear, plain English. More benchmarking to ensure competitiveness. The mission must always be moral and have a sense of purpose. Best-in-class information infrastructure - avoid repeat of 2017. Established back-up plans and business continuity plans - brainstorm worst-case disasters.
Reduce amount of stress with more days off - employees are dealing with new types of challenges since this pandemic. Employees should not have to participate on committees and projects that are not related to their core job function/role. These committees are a distraction and interfere with time necessary for primary work. Also, close the wage gap for minorities in the workplace and ensure pay keeps up with inflation.
Streamlined strategies and approaches More opportunities to learn from other functional areas and TAs so we're not reinventing the wheel each time More agile and bolder thinking
Stop with the woke leftist agenda.  The inclusion and diversity is morphing into critical race theory indoctrination.  If there are specific cases of discrimination and racist behavior in the company, address it immediately, and share the lessons learned with everyone.  But don't push leftist ideology such as systemic racism, unconscious bias and micro-inequities nonsense.  Advocate to treat everyone with respect, and remind people of MLK's words about not judging a person by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.  Stop with the equity arguments and talk about equal opportunity.  The best hierarchies are based on competence, not skin color, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other tribal characteristics.  We need to get work done, this is not a leftist, utopian, social laboratory.  Diversity of thought is what matters.  Diversity in the eyes of the leftist is a rainbow of people all saying the same liberal, leftist propaganda.  Merck needs to be apolitical!!
Forget about following the politics and social trends of the current day. Remember what we are here for. It doesn't matter who's running the country, or what color a persons skin is. It doesn't matter if what their personal life choices are, or even what ideals they stand for. We make medicine for everyone. Lets spend our time making medicine and developing new medicines, not worrying about following along with the latest 'fad' of the outside world.
Act swiftly and genuinely when it comes to social issues and racial injustice Simplify - there are too many "initiatives" that compete against other, similar ones - innovation, digitization/digital strategy, culture, DI&E, etc.
Continue to improve employees' wellbeing, more employee-centric initiatives and roll outs
offer more part-time positions or job-sharing positions
Provide flexible working hours.  Provide more support to work-life balance especially during COVID and work from home employees
Insecurity of work  de motivates  to work
To keep being company which support diversity, inclusion, safe to speak up, work-life balance...
I believe it will be important to continue a strong focus on inclusiveness and collaboration as well as professional advancement opportunities.
Allow a smooth transition from WFH. Although working from home, everyone has shown that we are able to work efficiently. Allowing people to decide on how often to come on site based on need would help with mental health. Also, Mental health days should be provided to employees. With working from home, some can be on their laptop all day everyday and allowing days to step away and take a mental break will help the company in the long run. In addition, please consider re-adding GIFs to Microsoft teams. That tool allowed for better commination within the team in a virtual world.
Communication and recognition.
Overall, I am really happy at Merck and think its a great place to work.  I would like to get updates directly from Merck for business critical issues in a more timely manner. It can be disorienting and confusing when I learn about important Merck updates from mainstream news before hearing it from my company. Thanks for the opportunity to give this feedback!
we need to take part in COVID vaccine development in order to help ending the pandemic.
Allow employees to permanently work from home to have greater work/life balance. Provide employees with opportunities for in-line promotions.  Provide employees with ability to accept new positions remotely (many roles are in New Jersey and require employees to be located there).
Encourage lateral thinking and alternative approaches to problem-solving that aren't bogged down by procedures and standard practices.  Allow people to flourish outside the framework that's been decided we should follow.  Streamline quality systems to eliminate hurdles for process/procedural improvements.
Having Well trained individuals who are willing to share knowledge, Having better management who can lead and assist with development and growth, Programs to enhance lab practices and understanding of one's job duties, Having more in-depth programs and seminars aiding in mental health, Reassurance from SLT and management about having a safe place to come work when it comes to racial injustices, discrimination, and Bias.   Celebrating more African American Culture, being able to speak up without it being a constant back and forth. Assisting parents with children with more options for work for an example: flexible work arrangements.
We need a much better team to help with questions on ordering.  IT needs improvements learn their job better, in order to help us with our issues.
Become more agile. Processes for innovation are heavy.
Align business needs to expectation / actions to perform by every department.
Provide training for administrative staff
Have the Ways of Working permeate top-down, especially through middle management, and have commitment to/demonstration of Ways of Working influence hiring decisions. Emphasize that our company needs to truly transform to stay competitive - simply optimizing our current business model is not enough. Good work needs to be visible, failures need to be taken as opportunities to learn, and communication needs to be transparent and direct. I truly believe we have the talent to make this company continue to be a success, we just need to adjust our cultural challenges to truly exploit the potential we have.
Allow for flexible work arrangements for all employees where feasible, and encourage a culture focused on work/life balance.
We need strong leaders and people managers (including mid-level leaders) who embody and don't just pay lip service to the values that come from Ken, Rob, and the EC. I'm inspired by and believe in what Ken and Rob say about what this company is and what they want it to be. How is there such a gap between that and what I've seen and experienced in the company? You can't change the culture and the way we work unless people see THEIR leaders doing the work to speak up, challenge/be challenged, call out microaggressions/bias, and focus as much on developing their teams as their own careers. It's hard to change such a deeply entrenched way of doing things, especially when people are still rewarded for the old behaviors. There is incredible talent within this organization. Lack of strong leaders and people managers (especially managers who create unhealthy team dynamics) significantly diminish our ability to benefit from and build talent to ensure the future success of our company.
Make sure the right resources (amount/quality) are allotted to organizations that need it. Some areas have struggled to retain knowledge due to the amount of employee turnover. It might seem like after hiring a lot of new employees the area is setup to operate, but not having right level of knowledge drains energy/capacity. Also, ensuring areas are properly staffed to be able to comply with the amount of new requirements that are launched every year.
VALUE TALENT -- especially who demonstrate Ways of Working but not recognized. Promotion should be about the person and not just looking at the role. Skill can be acquired but attitude is vital in a role.
Continue work life balance even in this pandemic. Support for family and personal health and continue doing business for our customers with priorities on health and safety.
In MSD it is verify difficult to get the promotion. Although you have much skills and you are doing the jobs for next level it is quite difficult to be promoted. There are lot of internal politics so if you are ready to do the job for next level you still have to perform being in your current position.
Employ managers who are leaders, people who are able to lead and mentor the team. It's important to have an understanding of what the team needs and how to grow them. My current manager is reactive and only act when I provide feedback. One of possible reason is that he doesn't have the depth and breadth of digital although he's the Digital Lead. Even if he doesn't have technical skills, at least there should be an ability of identify potential gaps based on experience (e.g. having a sense of key numbers and how to check if things are progressing well).
To fine tune the existing norms and applying them to those who are not being benefitted with existing norms
Good training about products.and update the knowledge
Increase recourse to handle new changes and improvements. All new resources are new to this industry which give some time delays.
invest even more money into research and research IT support
Keep going forward, for people and work
Our company is a great place to work!
To be more patient centric company
More money for R$D !
From a Brinny point of view, one area of concern which I feel needs to be thoroughly reviewed by senior leaders... would be balancing the upcoming cost & headcount challenges versus workload & projects to be completed. I think if we can make improvements here it would greatly support us in our work life balance efforts.
Digital tecnologies to increase more and more our performance
A fitness facility or gym membership discount for employees in the Durham, NC locations would be a helpful benefit for employees.
Actively re evaluate shift patterns on a year to year basis and consider the suggestions by the operators. Employees should benefit from taking on multiple tasks instead of one person being overburdened without the reflection in job title/pay
Continue to provide work/life balance. As a fully remote employee, I have had a hard time lately with very long work days.
Continue to transform process and remove roadblocks.  Identify root cause issues and do not implement quick fixes to resolve problems
Offer some additional  work-life  flexible job roles.  Some jobs where we could work from home 2 or 3 days a week and others where they are majority of the times working remotely.   Maybe offer a management  training program.  Also, a lot of our customers have weekend hours and they are not as busy on the weekends.  Maybe  once a month we should have some flexibility to work on a Saturday(or Sunday) and trade it out with another day that month. Essentially, swapping work days.  The doctors offices and our work environments are changing.  This change might also bring in more business for customers that otherwise normally would have been missed.
better work/life balance.
Don't forget about using common sense.
Give the right employee compensation, especially when it comes to yearly increment. Whether the employee's salary has reach the ceiling or not, if the employee deserves to get high increment because of his/her performance, MSD should give that deserving salary increase of the employee.
Hire for more makers, less project managers. Build more in-house, so that we own the information and are able to build more knowledge, faster
Politics & diversity seem to be taking on more meaning and time in our environment and that concerns me.  In the past I have always felt & believed Merck had the right balance - this new focus makes me uncomfortable
Attempt to streamline the location of resources or improve searches for them.
1. Ensure that employees have the flexibility to work from the office or from home.  2. Ensure that Merck sites have Diversity and Inclusion leads that are helping employees feel that they belong.   3. Develop mentorship programs for new employees to learn and develop 4. Give opportunities for employees to try work assignments that they are passionate about 5. Ensure that Merck sites have the latest IT technology and infrastructure to support the Digital strategy 6. Ensure Merck site's are well maintained with clean and refurbished for a welcoming work environment
Merck can get an organization chart on how each position works with the other positions in their department. Also better explanation on job tasks/roles for new hires just starting.  So that while training people can make the correlation for job specific tasks. Inclusion here is great! Attitudes/culture are positive.
Upper management in my opinion need to understand the constraints of the shopfloor and try their best to help to improve the condition so that the stress level will be reduced and more employees will be more willing to go that extra miles to deliver on our mission. After all MSD's goal is to save lives and make the world a better place to stay and not to create miserable life for the employees.
Strengthen our pipeline.  Make work from home permanent, if preferred by employee Limit travel, if not needed and provide strong ROI.
Refresh management culture. There is little to no room for new ideas in current leadership. There is no motivation to bring forth new ideas and accelerate innovation because management is a closed off echo chamber of older, white men. Merck talks a lot about being inclusive, but there appears to be little of those policies in practice. If Merck wants to retain younger talent, leadership needs to think about how they interact with the people that develop/execute the products services that comprise this business, and plan for longer term workforce sustainability.  I struggle to see a future at Merck because there are limited examples of technical staff that work their way up; management appears to mainly be composed of brands that were acquired or outside hires. Moving up in pay bands or position appears to be insurmountable, despite outperformance on annual priorities. Overall, the employee engagement and retention practices are poor.
Keep up the great work!
Consider streamlining and improving processes - the answer to every problem is not another SOP or layer of approval. This only slows down work and puts us at a disadvantage to our competitors. Maybe instead of people getting promoted based on adding another layer of system, people could be recognized for innovative ways to REMOVE barriers and shorten timelines because things are more efficient, without compromising quality or compliance.
SAP  is the global standard CMMS system used at MSD . I use SAP currently for Quality notifications and Maintenance Management. The use of SAP is cumbersome and  requires  a large amount of  resource  hours for   simple tasks and changes. I think are opportunities to be made in this space.
Continue working on diversity and inclusion. I acknowledge the grate efforts that the company does on this field, however I think that there is still a lot more work to do.
I appreciate the open forum meetings, but for lab-based staff, limited times and registration can make it difficult to attend.  I think continuing to open up the lines of communication and education on these issues may slowly move the needle to a more inclusive place.
Increase diversity at senior leadership level
Allow people the flexibility to work remote or come to the office as they desire and is appropriate for their role.  Always bet on innovation.  It is better to fail innovating then trying old technology.  I was disappointed in Merck in its choice of vaccine programs for COVID-19.  We did not bet on innovation and lost in any event.   Merck is also a more slow and steady wins the race kind of company.  We should embrace this and use it to our advantage.  When under pressure for speed Merck does not perform well in its decision making process.  The group think decision by committee misses on common sense practicality.  Thoughtful good decisions get replaced by fast churn that does not amount to a good end result.
Keep open the communication channel so people will continue to speak up
in some areas (example- Country Regulatory Affairs) we need more resources in medium and small size countries
Lots of pretenses about people first, however not necessarily practiced in reality.
More team building recommended within groups(even if it's virtual)
Clear communication with employees, especially those that are new (acquisitions) and hires.  There are some many trainings, mylearnings, surveys (like this one), Workday processes, etc. it can be a lot, especially for someone new.  It is important to clearly communicate expectations and provide resources for employees that have questions or need asisstance.
Consider making flex work arrangements that we have been using during Covid restrictions a permanent change, that allows for people to be able to more easier manage work/life balances without the concerns of commuting to and from work everyday, when alot of our daily work can be managed remotely.
Better defined Roles and Responsibilities.
continue allowing flexibility (and/or offer additional flexibility) for working mothers/fathers in order to better balance work-life with children (especially young children or children who are still schooling from home). Continue offer support to mothers returning to the workplace after maternity leave.
1.  Increase management opportunities so that Merck management looks like America 2. Start formal coaching program 3.  Increase budget for training  and  development 4. Find new ways to hire diverse talent.
work on peoples workloads, stress and encourage more than criticize. Everybody trys their best and sometimes people feel over worked and under appreciated.
Emphasize on the work/life balance.  Having a transparent culture will help with quick decision making. Empowering the employees: - Talent recognition - Defining the roles and responsibilities - opportunity learn cross functional
I think coming up with a process to differentiate roles and responsibilities between levels is a start. Merck does a great job at giving it's employees a lot of experience quick, but this is also a way to keep employees at any level they choose because everyone does the same thing. If the employee had clear guidance on what level X does, they would have something to drive towards.
Aggressively recruit and retain good scientists who contribute to the product portfolio, help bring products to the market quickly and thus make Merck a strong, competitive  pharmaceutical company.  At present we are losing intelligent, hard working scientists to our competitors.
No additional comments
Make leadership training more widely available to all levels to train from the bottom up as well
Continue with virtual Town Halls/EBBs, they are very informative
Focus on providing quality products in a timely manner. It would be nice to be on the offensive rather than the defensive.
Continue to keep employees safe during the Pandemic while still delivering life changing medicines to our patients.  As Merck and MSD has always done, continue to put patients first while maintaining the highest ethical values and standards.
Clear communication to the team on time  Dedicated resources instead of sharing or back filling diff works  Lot of initiatives with out prior info  Mental readiness of employees before assigning tasks or projects
TRASPARENCIA HONESTA ENTRE TODOS OS SETORES
Have clear goals, priorities and distribute the resources accordingly so that people are not overwhelmed
better work life balance
Better work-life balance.
Review system changes with local site SMEs and allow transition time
Short summary of speeches made during the sharing sessions
More emphesis on getting new products to market quicker. MSD is great at making their employers feel comfortable in the workplace and giving everything we require to do our jobs but struggle with product development
Managers at various levels should make them more available to openly listen and understand key issues, bottlenecks, and concerns.
Reduce redundancy in different Hoshin Challenges and have better overview of all linkages. Ensure new systems are evaluated thoroughly to determine whether it is beneficial for the end-users at all global sites before deciding on a global implementation.
Give more premium in terms of health insurance coverage especially for staff who has chronic diseases. Current plan is not sufficient to cover the entire family. Moreover it will be good to have Flexi benefit for staff to cover areas which they are able spend their $ on. eg wellness, gym pass, travel, or even donation.
Keep looking after their staff, without the staff there is no company.
Ensure that personnel in non-site based roles are kept as connected and informed as personnel working on the manufacturing sites
have a promising pipeline
Merck Leaders (at all level) need to continue to make employees feel that their health and well-being are key to them.  To do my work I need more information on Merck short, medium and long term strategy not only overall but for each product and tumor site I am working on. I also need way more information on competitors, their products, coming data readout... and their strategies.
Use the right resource and right person
offer competitive salaries and benefits, make sure teams are properly resourced
Hold on to key temporary personnel (make them permanent) who have a great knowledge and understanding of the vaccine processes.
Offer more opportunities for advancement
allowing more remote work so that family and work life could be balanced
always listen to the people
sometimes i feel there are to many meetings.
There is a deep-rooted culture of 'status quo' thinking/doing and it seems an inability or lack of interest in acting in ways to strengthen Merck's future.  We need a clear and ongoing message from leadership (beginning with Rob/EC and the HR LT) that agility, new ways of thinking/doing are the NEW EXPECTATION. We must measure against it and hold everyone accountable. In addition, we need to continue to infuse new hires who demonstrate agility and the ability to transform and to find and elevate those within the org who demonstrate those skills as well.  This is urgent for the success of Merck's future.
Embrace change - we need to change along with the industry and take a holistic approach to managing risk.  I've worked for a few other pharmaceutical companies I'd describe as pretty conservative.  Merck is by far the most conservative company I've ever worked for.  It is hampering our ability to innovate, to the point where we don't innovate, we follow what our peer companies are doing well after their actions are the norm.  There are many areas where we never follow.  Eventually this will catch up to us.  In fact, it may have to a large extent this year with covid and all the changes it has brought to the market dynamics.
Model the behavior we preach
Clearly communicate resources for training and professional development.
Perform the communication between leader, coaching personal and workers
Merck needs to evolve our working model and further focus on inclusiveness to help shift our culture towards our next normal.
- Training and Skill Development - Rotation and promote internal talent - Diversity Inclusion
Make the hiring process simple.
At this particular time, the system integration has been exhausting & has taken a toll on me. With observation of my co-workers, the Allflex Customer Service Department's morale is very low. We are doing what we can with as little that we have to get through our days. There are many variables as it is not just the system integration, but shortage of materials, co-workers being pulled every which way & direction, higher volume of sales this past Fall & Spring & Covid. I feel as we are on our own little island at our homes & there is no sense of a team. Don't get me wrong as I do enjoy working from my home, but encouragement, inspiration & uplifting support is needed in my department as we are experiencing a lot of change. We need to be convinced there is light at the end of the tunnel & this is just for now, not forever.

I am excited on the development of other vaccines and medicines that would help save lives and will still give us hope that we have a stable job.
I believe MSD will have brilliant future.
Not sure about the pipelines. What would happen post Januvia LOE is a cause of concern. Whether there will lay off or not that is also not sure.
I feel very comfortable working in MSD
No updates on future products  in the Segment  of  Type 2 Diabetes
This depends on pipeline success, some pauses or deletions of products not performing are disappointing. MSD revenue heavily dependent on Keytruda
Pipeline produces new products in good pace, that is exciting.
There are so many things that Merck can do to help improve people's health and therefore lives, that I can't help but feeling excited about it!
Merck's future appears to be heavily weighted on Keytruda expansion and success.  Does this make us vulnerable?
Seems to have a decent pipeline outside of oncology
In my role I am less informed about our early development/pipeline research and thus have less insights into our scientific future.
We have a good pipeline
I am hesitant from selecting "strongly agreed" because of the importance Ken Frazier played in the culture of the Company and the uncertainty of whether any CEO could live up to his legacy.  I am excited about the Merck pipeline and our mission.
Nervous about CEO change
I am hopeful that covid treatment and chronic cough get approved.  If they do, it increase my comfort level with being in Chronic Care and the longevity of the division.  If they do not get approved, I am very concerned with the viability of Chronic Care as it is structured
Concern about pipeline for Hospital Portfolio
Not sure what the future holds for oncology.
I’m excited to hear what is on the horizon within oncology as well as other markets.
Difficult to assess with recent changes in leadership
Not sure how well the company will bounce back after COVID and the investment into spinning off Organon.
Merck has always been a leader in the pharmaceutical industry.  I am excited about the direction of the company and future products that lie ahead.
ways of working are changing. focused products and innovation are definitely interesting for me to be part of the future and contribute to the success. it is very challenging but I feel positive the future.
I do have concerns about our pipleine and the ability for Keytruda to perfom over th eremaining years on patent to sustain us, and particularly when it is off-patent in the future
I'm definitely very excited, and we have a great short-term, medium-term pipeline, the question is more about how to ensure we keep and extend our leadership in the medium/longer term after the loss of patent of pembrolizumab within the next few years
I am excited about the future, our portfolio and plans for our current products for increment in MFG and resources for our patients, but sometimes it feels like in the system category (Automation / Manufacturing Execution / Data Management) we are staying behind.  Most companies are moving forward with a full integration of their systems (IoT 4.0), while we are still implementing items as they were done years ago, or cutting interfaces in order to manage equipment as silos.
Our vision for the future and pipeline of products appears weak.  We have based much of our future in only one area of our business without a clear strategy for success.
The financial impact of the pandemic continues to be a lasting concern
There are too many top down initiatives constantly being rolled out to sites with no input from the sites an no resources to help with the projects.  This is overwhelming the already strained resources.
I know Merck is entering into some exciting ventures with other companies and the fact that they want to become the top oncology company excites me.
I do believe as a company Merck is doing a great job globally with their goal of helping patients and driving innovation worldwide. As someone with a previous career in biochemistry and molecular biology I believe strongly in the future of the cellular and genetic therapies, and as we advance more toward precision medicine I believe that Merck could be doing more to advance their genetic/cellular therapeutics pipeline. I know the  corporate strategy is to become the premier immuno-oncology company by 2025 and we are heavily invested in this space which is great, however I would like to see the company capitalize on other key therapeutic opportunities that will position us strongly in the mid to long term future.
How Merck's direction will be after Organon spin off? for re-restructure esp. office based and people retention (as many talents left to Organon).
Our future depends on how we manage the stranglehold compliance has on us a
There are so many great opportunities that Merck offers to advance your career with Merck.
It makes me a little nervous that we have so much tied into Keytruda.  Also a little disappointed that we were so far behind the Covid 19 vaccine as we are one of the few vaccine companies. I hope we can continue to bring new to market and innovative products.
Although there were recently some delays and cancellations of new projects, I believe MSD is a strong company and will be able to build new exciting plans for the future
Not a lot of promising product in Chronic Care
Worried a little about our role in Primary Care with the company in the future
I believe the pipeline seems uncertain
Merck is not standing still selling only old products. I enjoy the fact that we have new products every year to talk about with customers. It keeps me excited about my job.
Great pipeline, great ethics and morals.  Wouldn't want to work anywhere else
As long as I am part of the company, then I am excited about its future!
We seem to have most of our pipeline eggs on one nest - Oncology. LOE is approaching in a few years. What is our next blockbuster?
Keytruda’s patent expiry is less than 7 years away, and to date outside of joint ventures our pipeline has brought nothing new and exciting to fruition for Oncology.
Appreciate the regular updates from Senior Management
I hope and pray that MSD will continue to discover new Drugs to provide for the World. I also Hope that MSD Philippines continue to Grow as a Company, because I never want leave MSD and I want to stay here in MSD until i retire.
I am excited and hopeful for Merck’s future
RD is ongoing, company is poised to keep on solving problems. Keytruda is BIG!
I applicate the policy and the products from our company, and want to say thanks for discovery and development section.
Need to understand about the product in pipeline..
MSD has always bringing innovative products
Clear that strategic choices needed to be made, but our very narrowed focus on just oncology and vaccines takes away from the diversity that made MSD more attractive in the past.
I feel that there has been significant change in the executive leadership of the company which warrants concern.
I am excited and waiting for the new launches in diabetic segment
As no new appointments in any divisions or no new product introduction
While I am excited about the work Merck has done and continues to do, the ongoing stress and isolation of WFH has taken a toll on my mental well-being and feeling of belonging and contributing at Merck.  I wish Merck would be a leader when it comes to vaccination and return to work plans and not continually extending the return to work date.  There should be no concern with vaccinated people returning to work as usual (without masks, distancing, etc.) - that is the point of a vaccine.
I am energized by Merck's commitment to sustainability and climate change engagement!!!
The work that we do worldwide for our clients are invaluable.
Merck could be the premier oncology company if they could get the over-the-top compliance people to learn about what we actually do as sales people.
I'm curious to see how the portfolio evolves after Organon spin off, does MSD rely on Keytruda or makes it more diverse, even with acquisitions.
There is a good pipeline of products coming and Merck/MSD is constantly looking at how it adapts the new ways of working
I think we have a great mission and wonderful vision and we have make a lot of effort to transform the company.  I do think we need a bit of time to implement many of these changes.  I feel we keep adding on transformation steps before we have implemented the previous steps.  Maybe slowing down the  number of changes can help us implement a few key ones with more quality.
we have some key challenges that need to be addressed. If we can begin to make some transformative internal changes then more excited. EG be more risk-taking, more nimble etc
Our future is our new drugs to market. Currently our discovery program is a black hole sucking in money. What is the most recent small molecule discovered at Merck to make it to market. It seems most of our pipeline is currently filled with acquisitions from other companies.
Overall there's lots of new job and opportunities, however, we are growing much faster than we can keep up with. Adding/replacing people takes time and there are struggles. It's like trying to sail a ship while building it.
I think the future is bright - we have a strong ambition to be the leading Oncology company.  The reason I didn't put strongly agree is there is a lot of ambition built into our financial assumptions which does create some risk.  I also think it will be critical for the new CEO to very clearly indicate his intentions regarding pipeline development and BD to increase confidence in long-term strength of Merck.
Excited to see how we develop into the best pharmaceutical company in the region
So much uncertainty in the Market and our pipeline

in the home office regime, I need to more time to finish the work to be done. I miss face-to-face interaction.
Human ressources are always a challenge, and having additionnal ones could be a great asset for the work life balance
Chronically under resourced in medical which leads to delays in outputs for the rest of the organisation
We have made great progress in providing digital and remote resources to the field teams for engaging customers.  We should continue to seek out, develop and implement remote engagement resources as well as continue to focus on a customized individual surround sound approach to customers both digitally and with live interactions.
Many of the tasks are more time intensive than necessary due to iPads instead of laptop connectivity. Also, not having the same access to laptops limits opportunities, especially leadership opportunities, and does not allow inclusion of all employees.
Very well supported by marketing, medical & legal.
I am able to do my job.  However, there are resources out there that could make my job more efficient, but some people who are change-averse or are comfortable with the current way we do things say that "we're fine doing it the way we do it".  So we don't plan or push for the improvements, or we simply maintain the status quo because it's good enough--or because people don't want to learn a new way.  It takes a great deal of effort to bring new ideas around sometimes.
But I would rather be able to get back to the office a few days a week to take advantage of double screen set up, a little more space to spread out, copy machine once in a while.
Given the situation, we are doing the best we can, however, i think Merck has lost perspective on what our providers are going through by constantly reminding us of our reach and frequency when we are in the middle of a pandemic.  We are doing the best we can.  I do not choose to stay home, Merck is telling us we have to.  It’s very difficult to get providers remotely.
we need to have improved global processes/tools otherwise have additional resources to address and deliver the stakeholder "quality deliverables" within strict timelines.
I generally have the tools to do my job, but sometimes because of Merck's regulations and tacit preferences from of leaders, my toolset is limited. Also all the processes in place slow down both my work and my team's work significantly.
Merck does a great job holding us back everyday.
It seems like a lot of the patient education and support materials are what we want but not necessarily what our customers need. I know there’s compliance issues on what we can provide but we have to look to our customers to see what they really want and need.
Oncology field emails are a joke.  In this virtual environment we need more flexibility to make them impactful.  Our DCO tries....but as per usual...Merck moves too slow.  Again, you want to be number one....act like it.
I appreciate the fact that within the last year we have been able to adapt some things more quickly than usual
We are severely under-resourced for the tasks & strategy that we are expected to execute. I have raised the flag that we will soon face people on "burnout" if we do not immediately take action to reduce projects, lower expectations, or increase resources. Our capacity is our greatest issue.
Sometimes out of my control so I have learned to cope, make it work
I will miss the opportunity to launch products and new indications/market events in live PDG and Lecture settings including offering wine and a 3-star restaurant. The physician and medical staff community value these, and it helps to launch new information.   Would love more leave behind resources to support 100% of our portfolio.
The resource constraints are limiting our ability to support the full scope of work and/or perform to the best of our ability because we are spread extremely thin over too many activities.
Updated home tools would be nice sine we do so much remotely now
more coaching and mentoring
Indeed I do.  However it is segmented and often inundating.  I can see efforts for improvement and also take personal action to streamline
Technology is lagging behind at Merck
MSD have been making sure that in our WFH status we have everything we need to work comfortable and with the necessary equipment such as an extra monitor, mouse, keyboard, chair and laptop support
Merck has the best resources in the industry.
The resources available are not on par with resources our competitors have access to
Backfills are not approved in a timely manner leaving teams to struggle for months.
FFM funding severely  limits meeting customers in a new geography, and remote engagements are not always possible
Due to company expectations, I sometimes feel they are sending me into a gun fight with a sword.
We have been begging for non-branded resources that would be meaningful or impactful for our cancer center leaders (non-clinical or tumor-specific interventions) and we have not made much progress on this need/request.  We need to rise above the clinical conversations we have with Dept Chairs to become more of a partner of the cancer center.  We can’t talk clinical research and can only discuss our approved indications/trials. These scientific leaders want to discuss the future not the past and we are restricted from engaging in forward-thinking discussions.
Backorders continue to be a challenge
Technology update happens slowly. PC and phones are outdated and underperforming while running most recent applications.
The organisation should place stronger emphasis and shift its focus to access from traditional commercial and marketing efforts. CFT and senior leadership should appreciate the importance and complexity of access, and have good foundational knowledge around access across different market archetypes (HTA and self-pay), which would help facilitate CFT efforts in enhancing access. At the same time, CFT and senior leadership should empower Access teams in fulfilling their roles and responsibilities (and resource accordingly), instead of creating additional teams and workstreams that are not familiar with the access environment and market dynamics. This requires adequate resourcing and recruitment/nurturing of the right talents with the right capability/experience/training
I believe I have the resources but not sure my entire team does.  We are working on this.
Time, tools, support from my manager: I have all I need
Feel constant under-resourced in my department, we have all the timeline to meet and have little time to test new ideas
As things are removed, and marketing pieces get delayed, it gets harder
issue with our new cookie policy vs measuring our website traffic. resulting in a massive drop in our website traffic which means i am unable to do this part of my job
Providers are extremely frustrated at the lack of managed care access I have for the products I’m promoting in my territory.
I would like to have all the equipment I'd do if I were at the office instead of having to buy them all myself, like a proper chair, maybe a printer [or easily access to one], feet support etc... but I understand the difficult logistic involving sending this to everyone...
I really appreciate the profound learning resources in MSD's internal platforms.
Communication differences between oral and written is confusing
Activities are needed for HCP
Many challenges
I feel that Merck creates unnecessary barriers for us to do our job well.  RAT tool, restrictions to programs, 12/HCP/year FFM rule, etc.  Marketing resources are getting better, however, I would like to see them available to us sooner when launching.
My team support and my experience makes my job to do well
At time materials are slow to be delivered and this hampers my productivity. In addition to this access programs have been slow to be actioned and this hampered access into the market.  Our competitors deliver access programs early and as such have built loyalty and gained market share.  By not doing this MSD has not been competitive or delivered solutions to unmet patients needs.
New and cutting edge resources are regularly being updated to improve the work settings
This varies by department. In my current department the answer is yes. In my previous department, that would be no.
Recent changes have disrupted options
If and when they are accessed.

Certain processes in MSD could be more lean & effective or pragmatic. Some platforms used are more outdated and less intuitive.
work life balance is key concern
My retrenchment
When questions are related to Manger, it is hard to answer because in MSD we do not have one manager, we have more than 1 managers, so it is confusing whether you will referrer to functional manager or Admin manager. If both managers have different attitude and working style , you may like one and may not like other, so when we take survey , don't know which manager we need to keep in mind.
Being away from my family is putting a lot of stress on my marriage. And being a weekend dad is not good for my family
Work & Life Balance Hours and days of work
Choosing to correct next step in my career
I worry about my anxiety and metal stress from so much working at home, and so much admin and process. I feel like a data processor alot of the time and it is completely de-moralising.
Workload, not enough resources to get the work done, the percentage of 1 year contracts (contractors) is too high to perform well also in the future(loss of time and resources if people constantly leave) and to keep knowledge within department
common sense being used in this company , IT area being more and more difficult, so many updates in any area what is not in a man capability to get known and apply to the business, the way how is within company pushed diversity and inclusion which is on boarder of white discrimination
Not being able to meet compliance requirements even though I do all I can to live up to the standards. Processes are not supported by automatic measures/tjeck ins but are left to random/manual tjeck ins. This is a big risk since things can fall in between two chairs.
I don’t feel secure  I receive many indirect messages that I am old and the company needs new blood!
Feel that older people's experience is not valued anymore. Most of my colleagues are younger than me and they favour quick fix solutions but do not have the experience to understand the problems that can arise and if i try to tactfully point them out am seen as been clinging to past processes (I understand why the processes were designed in certain ways) i am very competent in technology and love developing more efficient approaches using it but am never involved in those teams.I feel that i will be forced to leave and get a job where my experience is more valued
Everything is already politicized these days. Sports, TV, Entertainment. Don't need politics to integrate into my work environment as well. Without politics it would be much easier to bridge gaps between each other, as we're viewing each other as individuals we're willing to interact with, instead of viewing the other as a representative of some political opinion, left right or center. It just puts a focus on differences.
Not my problem attitude enjoys living inside Merck or MSD, complicated by processes that are not closed loop and by audits in pharmaceutical industry. It all causes most of the people take defensive position all the time and don't participate as bearers of their unique knowledge.
Climate Change
Being told that the company is worried about my health and wellbeing whilst at the same time reducing the number of staff and  increasing workload... it seems the company makes the 'right' statements but its actions shows it is not concerned abut it's staff
I'm concerned about the stress that several colleagues have been exposed to the last year (mostly related to the NewCo project but to some extent due to the COVID-19 pandemic).
That my efforts and hard work to ensure the teams wellbeing is noticed and valued by the team.
I have a good job with a nice team, good pay and good benefits. I am being treated fairly. The company is so conservative and all focused on Pembrolizumab that I am not sure I will be able to find any professional fulfilment or meaning, but let's give it a good try.
I am concerned about Merck Canada Leadership.   The feeling "What's in it for me in the short term" vs. "What's in it for Merck in the long term" is the sentiment.   The strong leaders are proactively leaving the organization.   What "sounds good" is trumping what is reality.   Very concerning.  Our revenue is decreasing based on decisions that were made in the last three years (beyond COVID impact).  Very concerning.
Commute / required time in the office once we're back.
Being able to do my job adequately when Merck is my biggest obstacle. There needs to be improvement in their black and white policy in regards to ways of working. There needs to be a gray area and more specific to geographical openness. The constant push for remote activity negatively impacts sales and needs to be addressed.
Loss of human interactions and social skills by constant masking.  Siloed thinking on pandemic response with no regard to downstream consequences. Schools refusing to open fully and normally.  Lingering virus fear long after necessary.  Unreasonable and ridiculous restrictions/lockdowns on daily life.  Divisive culture and politics.  Increasing taxes and government ineptness and interference.  Politicians and government officials fueling vaccine hesitancy that spreads to vaccines other than Covid.  Ex. Robert Redfield claiming masks were more effective and would keep him safer than a vaccine, continuing to mask after vaccine etc.
I am concerned with the direction of the company with respect to its leadership. I am concerned that a downsizing will be needed as there are many expensive fte currently being recruited to the company. I am concerned with own career development path as our reorganization appears to have made that a low priority.
Financial Security
work life balance is a concern, work load has increased to a level that is not possible to complete within the 39 hour work week.  This is ok occasionally but it is now constant The intensity of the work adds to levels of exhaustion, and frustration.
Concern is that Merck CEO and management is getting involve with the "woke" culture in society and this will only alienate half of the population. VERY CONCERNING!!!!!
Financial security in retirement
Internal pressure and stress to compete against my peers. During Covid it feels like a rush to "measure" everything and the culture is moving away from a collective & collaborative mindset to a "me, me, me" environment where we have to jockey to show how we are differentiating ourselves internally as opposed to working to stave off external pressures on our growth
Rapidly changing work priorities.
Great to see new leaders at the executive and senior leadership levels across Merck but concerned with the risk of these leaders introducing hasty changes without appreciating the value created over the last 10+ years
level of workload an stress in the company is high and increasing. Although we have resources to try to mitigate these topics (Live it, balance it, fuel it etc...) it is just not sufficient. The level of workload remains the same for long time and it is expected to keep on increasing. We can´t be doing the same and more with same resources. In addition, more and more mandatory "small topics" are added into our daily tasks such as SfC, MyLearning, reporting tools, etc....as a company we need to focus on things adding value to our products and customers
Whether or not the opportunity is there to go from Job Share to Full Time
Somewhat concerned about safety once we return to the workplace
Ensuring my colleagues are supported so we are successful in our submissions, supporting reviews and Agency Interactions.
Be VERY careful not to give a unique benefit to one generation without considering how it affect others.  A good example is the increase in Paid Parental Time Off.  EVERYONE agrees this a GREAT benefit to the target group but it not only leaves out those not in the target group it also places the burden of additional work on others when the target group is using this benefit.  This has caused some disruptions on the production floor and even has had the side effect of making the target group embarrassed and reluctant to take that much time away from work while adding additional work to their colleagues who do not get this benefit.
Work and personal life balance.  Working from home have increased work load significantly, specially this year 2021.   This increase in work load is not related to Organon spin-off.  Working 11-14 hrs a day and still not been able to complete all tasks.  Working on order of priority on day by day basis.
Job satisfaction is at a low point and what I'm most concerned about at work.
I am concerned about the environement and consequences of the climate change on the population
-significant/ frequent personnel turnover within teams after brief tenure -Work/ life balance;
Understanding what my priorities . Apparent inequalities in hiring.
Balancing work/life priorities
Hostile work environment/All employees extremely overloaded with work
Have concerns regarding what the post-COVID work environment will be like. As a field based individual, I'm concerned the face-to-face interactions with Scientific Leaders (SLs) will be reduced and greater emphasis placed on remote engagements. I joined Merck so I could actively engage SLs in person with the backing of a solid, reputable company like Merck. If Merck leadership makes a decision to maintain a significant portion of remote, virtual engagements, I will look for opportunities elsewhere.
Increased product demands and expectations in an environment that is understaffed and limited in its capacity to meet the demands.
Other - I am currently concerned with my ability to move to a different role within the organization.
the pandemic - long term impacts of it and return to normal (ish) whenever that might be
Direction Merck is heading to.
Other: My Salary/Compensation vs my peers is not equal for the impact and value I deliver for the business, in addition to my years of experience and degree. Salaries and adjustments should be based on merit and not goals or targets.
My promotion COVID-19
Meaningful career opportunity/promotional consideration as our team is stagnant
You may lead a horse to the water, but you can't make him drink
Stress levels that lead to physical "issues", but they get woven away.
Job security - the constant need to "compete/ask" for a promotion rather than normal promotion over time. Makes me not want to stay long-term that I have to "request" recognition and job advancement.  The fact that MSD enables one of the worst human-rights abusers in the world and will remain silent about what they're doing but will jump immediately and react to anything where it's politically popular to condemn it or there's no cost to doing so. I think MSD and other companies are complicit in making the world a worse place in the long-term in terms of us speaking to each other and enabling other bad government regimes when it's convenient to you..
Workload and -pressure
Company future and performance (country focus)
I had a very successful year in 2020 and bonus was taken away from me to give to those who were not successful. I would have won the VP award and trip. I feel that a company bringing in billions could afford to pay bonus to those below plan without taking it from us above plan.
Two many "silos" within my Dept. It doesn't help at all, we do a lot of no added value job, neither for the company nor for balancing personal and professional life
work/life balance
Work/life balance and ability to disconnect.
Concerned about the way Merck is supporting political events in an unbalanced way.
I'm truly concerned about our team strategy. We have a lack of direction and from what direction we get it seems to be coming from flawed data or flawed market intel. Asking the field and connecting with the field can give a lot of insight.
Work/life balance
Ken Frazier's political comments are making my job more difficult with customers.
Working for my Team, for Merck but most important for the patients.
Financial Security
I am also consistently concerned about the environment and the preservation of smaller farms
Work Life Balance
work/life balance
not being able to perform the overwhelmingly big amount of admin tasks that come with my job (and every other job)
work / personal life balance
Concern about the risk of elevating COVID restrictions while the population has not been fully vaccinated (including myself not being vaccinated in time, due to vaccine availability and choices in vaccination schedule).
work life balance
Working from home fatigue
Level of inclusion within site and lack of succession planning
Stagnation of career, working in a toxic environment.
Constantly high workload w/ no breaks or slow down
Travel restrictions and not able to meet family.
How it will be going back to the office after 1 year away and if we will have the possibility to work more from home since it seems to be working very fine.
Upper Management have been resistant in acknowledging our concerns in regard to work-life-balance.  We are a support function with a high volume job. The people we support have increase significantly every year, yet our support function has not. We are suffering health issues (mental and physical) due to the fact that we have a constant need to run faster and faster and to work several hours of overtime every day. The issue has been raised for the past 3 years without any acknowledgement from previous manager and upper management. Our new manager has been fighting our case since she took over our team one year ago and finally we have been granted a contractor to help out. We need a permanent solution. We need to be heard, when raising concerns about work-life-balance and we need to be able to work in accordance with our contract without a constant need to give extra hours of work on a daily basis.
COVID and returning to the office
Engineering/Technical Expertise and Quality Level
Work/life balance
Equal opportunity for development
work/life balance for our global team, as we work in a truly global team , mainly people located in AP & US are having to work extensive long hours every day to be able to collaborate with the many people in the team crossing different time zones, and the volume  of work is enormous and never slowing down.
Assistance for home office set-up will be of great help!
Overig = the job is fragmented into many different projects and other tasks
Inflation & increased taxes and personal compensation to manage increases while also handling higher education costs
Decision making process within the company.  Too much Group Think going on.
work/life balance
Answer to 17: Right now, I'm most concerned about finding another job or some other meaningful way to spend my time.
Work -life Balance
Mental Health
Vaccines are good, but ones that we know the safety studies for.  Merck of Old would have never said this mRNA vaccine is safe without doing the full safety study's in animals and humans.  No one can say there will be NO safety issues in the long run because you can't.  People need to be given the whole truth of all the animal studies and human studies that were done.  Merck would never take a vaccine into people if animals died.  I am hopeful that in a few years we will have seen NO problems with these new vaccines but you can not guarantee they are safe, no one can yet.  Natural immunity is strong and working for most people but that has been removed from any discussions anywhere, why?  Everyone has a right to choose to be vaccinated and should absolutely have the right to wait for the long term safety studies to be done.  Politics are playing a huge role in people's lives now and those who want to wait on this vaccine are being made to feel like they are wrong and not helping others
Other: Maintaining motivation can be challenging given the large amount of time require to do the more administrative aspects of the job ( updating systems such as USPT/mySD, RDS, Orion, GCM) versus the time actually spent on regulatory work (determining regulatory requirements/strategy, authoring submissions, etc).  Also, we update the various systems and processes so often that one often feels they are just constantly relearning their job.
Our ability to compete with competitors in the same therapeutic space
Manage the high workload
The impact Covid is having on our jobs, industry, and opportunities in pharma.   I really feel that this job is not what is used to be.  Some things are more interesting intellectually, but the mechanics of the job and our day to day, in fact, week to week tribulations are related directly to the impact of Covid.  The weekly RAT tool is the bane of my existence right now.  It is so demotivating every time I have to cancel an appointment...and NO, you cannot just convert to OCM with every customer.  With larger customers (>25) it is not possible.  These are the places I am expected to get most of my business and I have very little access thanks to the RED Rat tool.
Career Progression at Merck
I have a concern that this company is too big to be able to achieve the goal for cross-functional collaboration and we waste resources working still very much in silos.
I am very concerned about the very poor work/life balance which requires 60 hour every week.  Every time we lose colleagues to external jobs, there is more work piled upon the current PMs.   There is no outsourcing, or infilling. It is very discouraging.  There is also a strong subjective bias to promote and reward Keytruda team members more consistently than any other project space.  It is well documented within our department, based upon recent promotions.  It has been identified by other folks from Merck departments, as well.
The balance of work and life is extremely difficult at this time.  My managers continue to tell us to look for ways of taking work out of the system and we do that as much as possible.  However, additional requests continue to be added on to the workload we already have, so we are becoming overwhelmed. This leads to many extra hours of work and the inability to focus on personal life and health.
The Varicella department 57245 does not have a functional training program and is running production at a level that does not support training technicians. Managers up through directors do not understand the process well enough to support technicians on the shop floor. Family lives are being disturbed due to the amount of forced overtime to achieve upper management's production goals.
The safety of my family in another country.
Integrating and making the business fly
balance of work and life outside of work  the right number and right skills on the team to perform the workload within the E2E
Balancing the constant change  due to pandemic.. large levels of stress to regain lost revenue and pressure to do it one way went customers are all in different sutuation
When I challenge ideas, dept LT has already made its decisions. It's pointless to raise concerns anymore when decisions have been made.
note: by staying healthy I mean mentally. A lot of ongoing changes are requested from us which makes it difficult to find rest from time to time.
in this current environment the multiple meeting during the day to resolve issues for multiple programs does not allow for a good life balance ,as work needed to be completed is not done during the day due to meeting, so many extra hrs at night are needed and also on weekends. Furthermore, it is hard to find time to relax and take vacation as the demands are constant for multiple programs.
well being of my team
overtime, too big scope of work expected to be done
lots of useless actions going on thru organization, engaging for nothing. Too high work load
Would like to ensure that adequate budget is made available for headcount, acquisition of new compounds, and conduct of innovative trials
work life balance (towards work)
Work/life balance and burnout
A major concern is not knowing how Merck will approach employees returning to the office. I've been 100% remote since the pandemic started (March 2020). The arrangement has allowed me to be productive while also having opportunities for family time. This is in spite of increased workload. My concern is maintaining the same degree of productivity if expected to return to the office on a regular basis. I hear that Merck senior leadership is reconsidering remote options; however, they have stated publicly that they are not fans. The thought of another major change and potential impact on my family is concerning.
Obtaining healthy work life balance, as no priorities or timelines have changed for Merck, regardless of the Pandemic induced personal stress.
West Point has a massive backlog of product awaiting release to market, which is unlikely to be resolved in 2021.  It's taking longer than ever before to release our material and resolve the many issues surrounding these batches. Without an increase in headcount to help address these problems, our backlog will only increase.
Family in other countries with no access to the COVID-19 vaccines
I am concerned that new leadership seems to place less value on the "how" people do things, more so on the "what".  Places a low value on people-focused leaders. Ways of working are in danger of going down the toilet.
Fair opportunity
Work life balance is a key concern.  Work life balance has gotten harder to manage in the last year as the finance department continues to add to the workload and does not seem concerned that people have to work many hours outside of normal working hours and weekends in order to get things done.  It seems to be a norm to be double or triple booked on meetings, instant messages are sent outside of normal working hours which gives the impression that people should be online at all times.   It seems to be normal that people take "vacation" but are still working.  There is talk about well being but management actions and workload increases does not practically allow for people to take time off for themselves.
Work life balance does not exist at Merck. We are always being challenged to work more every year!
I feel like Merck has been very flexible with work and child care balancing during shut down but now that we are opening up but my kids school isn't back to full time I am feeling anxiety about everything.  I also do not like how political Merck has been, I feel very irritated by all the social justice emails and trainings.  it is very condescending and one sided- we get enough of it from social media and being from a law enforcement family I feel very insulted by a lot of Merck's communication.  I feel it is inappropriate for the workplace especially from leadership.
I am concerned that I may not return to site after working from home since March 2020.
Continue Business responsibilities and safety.
I see myself remaining at MSD for many years, but Job Security remains a concern because of the 'headwinds' and budget shortfalls we have coming up. I feel we sometimes make snap decisions when we need to cut budget, and I feel anxious about my role when those discussions are happening.
Better if management involve the resources in more ways so that we dont feel isolated.
Balance with the opportunity to work at home during COVID has shifted: Balanced home vs work is better! I am concerned that, when restrictions will be lowered, working from home will not be implemented in the standard way of working at QA. This would be a great miss in my opinion because it provides a healthier work/private balance to me. And extra because I accepted a job for which I have to work 1 day a week more (4 days instead of 3) and this would really help to have it better balanced.
Our border is out of control and there will be unintended consequences throughout the country. We should help our own veterans, homeless people and people who struggle with concerns about where their next meal will come from before we help people who come here illegally.
Seriously fearful the current administration is overtaxing me, overtaxing our products, overtaxing my employer, overtaxing citizens.  The money we need to live on, create with, develop with, advertise with, etc. seems to be going nowhere in this administration so quickly that truly Merck is going to have to down size to accommodate the taxes.
Lack of "we" attitude; Roles and responsibilities between associates/ managers are not very clear; Delegation of task by superiors; Continuous and un-necessary follow-ups; Lack of motivation, inspiration, awards.
Competency, Capabilities, Work Ethic, Culture
I would like to get further update about the future organization in our NWA cluster after the spin off and the Business strategy in Morocco. Thank you.
Staying mentally* healthy. Thinking about work 24/7, while not at work, with everything else going on in the world, is not sustainable for me.
Other: Managing stress in the current environment
There is more workload than can be handled without significant overtime.  Our electronic systems in MMD are not fit for use with external partners (CMO's).
Job Growth and career advancement. How can i be of value to my teams?
Making a meaningful contribution in comparison to the many gifted and accomplished colleagues in my group.
I am worried about being required to get vaccinated.
maintaining a productive and active lifestyle
Burnout (my team, and myself)
I am very concerned that as a publicly traded company, we have upper management that broadcasts their personal positions on political issues and speaks so broadly and on behalf of Merck. It seems like such a double standard - we as employees have to take training on how to conduct ourselves on social media when it comes to politics if it shows that we work for Merck in our profile. Seems like the same standards are not applied to our upper management. In my opinion, political preferences and opinions should be kept out of the workplace - especially when we are a publicly-traded company.
