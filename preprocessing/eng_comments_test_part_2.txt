There are lots of initiatives that sometimes affect our work load. It’s too overwhelming.
Compliance introduces every quarter a new set of rules w.r.t. engagement with HCP’s. It’s frustrating and disregarding for the HCP’s and us.
My department makes a good effort, but it's a big organization and barriers still exist.
The field is ruled by compliance.   It’s a joke now the the answer is always NO.
Over the last 18 months more barriers have been put into place.  While the RAT tool was necessary at first, we have gone far past reasonable.  It’s time to go back to work!  Now with the 12 FFM per HCP limitation, it's incredibly difficult for some divisions with large reps/territory to make that happen.  I know data was cited to us that historically oncology wasn’t using all 12 of those anyway, but that data was pulled from a time when each territory had 3-4 reps.  Also, now we cannot allow alcohol at speaker events.  We are limiting and limiting and limiting.  It’s no wonder people are leaving to go to other companies without so many restrictions on work.  If simply the RAT tool would go away, it would be an immense help.
in animal health, we simply don't have the manpower in key areas to support our business, i.e., business operation functions
The increased COVID measures that we have been placed under the past year has truly halted our ability to go out and perform our job like we need to be able to. Our competition is out there with no restraints and the COVID measures in place are getting in the way of our business .
I feel my organization is taking good steps to improve work processes for more efficient use of our time.
We actively look for and eliminate barriers wherever possible
Most of the barriers are corporate policies and procedures.  My department can’t remove those.
More complicated every day.
Multi-tiered governance structures remain a barrier for rapid decision making
my individual department is not visibly involved in any initiatives. only on the next level up, there is a lot going on, but our needs and secondary to all the efforts
Although we are improving every day I see room for improvement to  eliminate barriers as non value added administrative tasks & requirements, system issues etc
Removing barriers is difficult to do at Merck.  We are so process driven, that it's difficult to create change.
It doesn’t help if this is happening at department level, as we are not synced across departments, functiones, geographies, global, local...
As someone that works on an acquired company study, I sometimes find it difficult to get individuals to think outside of the box, as typical Merck standards do not necessarily work for these non-standard studies. Getting alignment slows productivity and the ability to get answers to questions in an appropriate amount of time.
I think that there has been an increase over the past year or so of adding work that is not value add to our plates.  We are being asked to produce more summaries of our work to upper management, do more metric tracking and more administrative tasks which pulls us away from our strategy work which is vital to the PDTs.
Our associate director makes it very difficult for us to do our tasks efficiently and safely on the floor.
Too many projects and activities that rake up alot of time
There are many barriers and most barriers  go over multiple functions and cannot be removed by the department alone. The growing barrier is the same people supporting all programs
With the new management team we have since a few months, I can clearly see a massive improvement in that regard. I think we are certainly trying - but it is difficult to do that when you have global and local regulations to adhere to. Currently, there are many initiatives under way to help with that. I have not seen or experienced actual removal of barriers, however.
Simplicity and sharp focus are the key for exceeding customers’ expectations
this question cannot be limited to a single department since most of impactful changes require cross-functional approval. The answer addresses the wider context.
We are doing good, but need to get better in this process. To start celebrating success in removing barriers and making it visible to the team will help in creating momentum.
Virtual programs have too many barriers otherwise I would agree more stongly
I feel that we could do a better job in dealing with employees who become barriers.  Managers need to do a better job in providing strong feedback when employees remain in a silo--that  slows down our work
We try but there are still factors holding us back.
I do not think it is departmental related.  I feel that the compliance barriers are becoming overwhelming, especially our relationships with colleagues at AZ
Our department does a stellar job removing strategic business challenges or barriers. Although, in terms of emotional, or even racially provoked traumatic barriers that do exists to many employees of color, many managers and leader (not of color) struggle to empathize, understand, and find important enough to dedicate resources to resolve these types of barriers that slow down productivity at the marginalized employee level... even when these issues are voiced and an attempt to promote a resolve has been suggested.
There are lots of procedures to get equipment fixed and this is a time sink.  Because of how facilities is organized, my dept. cannot necessarily remove these barriers.
Barriers that slow down work in terms of overhead of requirements, reviews and rules is one area that Merck is weak. Our systems put too much trust in what become check-box exercises.
We have made great strives during the pandemic that need to stay in place in the future.
Although some processes are still slow and time-consuming, these are mostly related to compliance/legal SOP and therefore hard to change. All other impediments are solved as soon as possible
Our department does not have the resources to keep up with the amount of work that is being expected of us.
Lots of SOPs with maximum ambiguity
While there are some tools available that help complete work faster, other items are manually managed, which take up an unnecessarily large amounts of time (i.e. SDS management).
Embrace sales reps working more remote days than field days if that is what works best and is driving their business right now.   Return to embracing the sales numbers as a definition of how well a rep is doing, instead of metric-ing everything. It should be more important to drive business, then to hit a certain metric of X number of emails sent per week or X number of calls per day. Let’s return to trusting reps to drive their business, being true business owners and only look at metrics when the numbers aren’t where they need to be. Otherwise you’re going to create an environment where salespeople not only have to hit their sales numbers, but hit other multiple metrics that can seem arbitrary and can lead to burnout and/or leaving Merck.
Communication between shifts/teams can have a delayed response.
not really.
In a virtual sales world we need to get better at resources for customers. For example, emails that communicate what our product and/or tumors are to obtain appointments.
I'm too new in my current role to assess.
The attempts are there, but still have challenges of finding the right contacts and visibility beyond our area.
I do think there is an appropriate and well-intentioned focus on keeping Merck safe from a compliance perspective.  However, some of the direction creates substantial business risks.  There is also an opportunity to empower people to make decisions.  Finally, the level and extent of alignment required in Merck to move forward is a barrier that needs to be removed in the interest in simplification and moving more quickly.

Return to the work shifts we had before the pandemic
1) Upgrade IT systems 2) Work load balances 3)Competent Leader
Work life balance. Since it is work from home, sometimes boundaries between work and personal time  are not being observed.
Continue being the pioneer for change
We try never to forget that medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have never failed to appear. The better we have remembered it, the larger they have been.  We seem to have forgotten!
Make a clear instruction to each team.
Cross functional team collaboration is one of cornerstones to success. It means mutual agreement and discussion are crucial for decision making. I strongly suggest non-HH functions e.g. GMSA to discuss their support change to HH due to structure change ahead of final decision so that we can identify a solution to manage changes and collaboration between HH & GMSA
leaders to lead by example, embrace desired culture/ values and provide timely feedback to jerky behaviors/ actions to promote D&I and work efficiency
I am happy with the current policies and Way of working. Hence do not have any comment on this
Prioritize on what projects to go first and allocate enough resources to implement the project. Currently there are multiple projects that come to site level but with no additional resources allocated and all projects are on high priority. We need to allocate people at shopfloor to support the projects and this impact the efficiency and quality of work at shopfloor level as people cannot focus on their main job scope anymore.
If feel they are doing a great job currently and I do not need anymore assistance
Actually go through with training when it is first suggested to staff. Create development opportunities that staff are excited about and don't feel it's a chore to complete. Allow flexible work arrangements in traditionally non-flexible environments such as manufacturing teams. Encourage and support staff to not only think of new ways to do things but to actually follow through the changes. Create clear and concise guidelines for movement up/away from their current roles that they can create goals to reach. More visibility of work happening by staff beyond their roles. Keep roles and responsibilities where they are meant to be. Ie. Production staff doing manufacturing, not performing trials. Having different tiers of staff within teams eg. Having staff who are lead manufacturers, staff who are support manufacturers and staff who are there for cleaning/staging etc.
I am very satisfied with the present company situation
Look at workload and hence pressures people are under.  People are starting to show physical signs of stress, as they are asked to go above and beyond continuously.
Continue with all small gestures to the employees. :) Keep having high expectations of employee performance but there is a need to ensure a more balanced level of requirements. Reduce the amounts of emails, look for a more healthy email culture.
Communication and decision should not only to be top down but also from bottom to up.
We come from different regions and work with people from different regions. Although we work together very well, sometimes the deep interactions cross region in cultural level are not enough. It will be great if Merck and MSD could pay more attention on this and enhance the cross regional interactions, especially during this period.
cross-function department should think more about bussiness requirement and have a deep understanding about the bussiness. be open-minded and be aglie
Strong pipeline for new products
Put the right managers on the right job
Work towards more efficient way of working, optimizing processes to enable delivery to the business in time, ensure to prioritize appropriate priorities for the teams to work on in order to achieve the necessary goals
Consider better work/life balance for example 4 day weeks, promote remote working etc.
I think MSD is already doing a lot by communicating frequently and concise on COVID and other topics and promoting an active life with good work/life balance and quality time with the family. I however do feel more engagement is needed around fortifying our future (status, intent etc) and other strategic initiatives cause at the moment people on the shopfloor notice and see too little of this.
MSD is a wonderful company to work with!  Pursuing continuous improvement I'd say that:  although we're already in a good path, I'd reinforce the job rotation and transparency of the personal career path/opportunities. Workday has been already a great step ahead in my opinion, but I believe we can still do more
Due to covid-19 we are working from home as far as our work tasks allow us. However, I do not feel MSD has been very active in wanting to make this challenging situation easier. We should have been offered desk/chair/screen/phone bill covered/broadband covered. These are simple actions the company could have taken to make this sudden new situation with forced home office easier on all employees. I am aware that this pandemic is a new and very challenging situation for all, but still feel that the support from MSD could have been better. We were offered to take our chair home or borrow one (which entailed having the possibility to transport back and forth is you have to go in to the office for a day - not a good solution. The same story with any other equipment.
open communication, giving equal chances regardless of sex and age,informing about initiatives and  opening of new possibilities of development or assignments, not choosing only managers' favourites. Narrow thinking of managers who do not use diversity and inclusion criteria in their work.
Aim to be a true global company across all functions - to deliver on our mission and make the company a better place to work. In my area there are limited opportunities to progress within country or region and global opportunities are only available to those located in the US. Talent should trump geography but the opposite appears to be the reality. At a time when our competitors are setting up regional hubs around the world focused on development of new products, MSD is falling behind. It is demotivating for people not to have clear career progression pathways and the US HQ-centric approach stifles real innovation across the wider organisation.
To have more trust and more free space in certain areas for strategic employers.
Listen to the employee and customers to ensure that we can make MSD a great place to work in and a company that customers (HCPs) would love to collaborate with. We are too KPIs driven, listen to the market and be competitive..
Look sometimes a bit more at basic (ometimes even simple) principles to do the right things, e.g. solve problems thoroughly instead of just moving on. We do make steps but we are not there yet,
Simplify align and prioritize the number of MSD initiatives outside of run the business
Consider the changes that have occurred to work and personal life during the pandemic - assess the good adn bad aspects of this and incorporate this into working life at MSD
Taking into consideration everybody in the company and everybody's input.
MSD should work deeply on employees development carriers as well as give them more visibility specially during this spin off period . as i already highlighted . MSD is exigent in term of employees output by achieving target but not aligned with the market ( competitors) in term of salary, advantages ..... and fully absent in employees studies support to develop them
Actually realize the growth mindset in the people we employ up and down the organization. Talk less about Agile and actually be more agile. We are consultant led rather than led by our own culture and mindset.
keep up the good work, communicate any changes timely
We need more brands to introduce in today’s market.
Sensitize higher level management to have respect for the time and commitment it takes their employees to do "non strategic" work
Focus on inventing novel products that eliminate the burden of disease and work to get them to the people.  I'm not sure of the value of contributing/commenting on broad political issues.
Hire more African Americans as coaches in the NASU Lab.  Hire more period.  And when they are hired don't dump all of the responsibilities on them.
More structured approach to employee development. ADP & GMAP are great for a few, similarly structures development opportunities would be appreciated by the many.
Allow the "younger" up-and-coming workers to take on bigger more visible projects  Do away with individuals on "preferred" lists for certain workers Provide better career pathing guidance
establish ways to set itself apart from companies in the same industry to enable a higher level of hiring external candidates in areas with strong job markets / competition
Ensure everyone has a proper work set-up at home. Ensure we have the right, most updated technology to stay connected. Ensure eveyone is being check on weekly or at least bi-weekly for well-being/mental health with a simple question that shows the company cares about how everyone is doing.
Need to align objectives/priorities across divisions and support functions to enable appropriate resources to be allocated to drive faster transformation and greater agility.  We still operate too much in silos.
Don't make returning to the office mandatory, leave it up the people who have successfully worked from home and improved their productivity being home based.
Be as transparent and open as possible with their employees
Learn to say "no" to projects and to discontinue projects when the drivers change.  We are suffering consequences of saying "yes" to everything and continuing some projects that no longer have value and are consuming valuable resources.  In order to do more with less, we need to make this adjustment.    We also need to fundamentally transform how we do things so we don't burn people out with excessive workloads and unrealistic expectations.  Sometimes we rely too much on adjusting existing processes when the question we need to ask is "what process would I build if there were no existing process?"  If we don't shift toward that mindset, we'll be making incremental improvements going forward rather than transforming our Ways of Working.
MORE SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTS IN CVM BU BEST ALLOWANCE AND INCENTIVES ACROSS PHARMACEUTICALS  BEST APPRAISALS AS PER THE RATING ACROSS INDUSTRY  MORE HCP ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMMES  BEST IN CLASS INSURANCE AND RISK BENEFITS TO THE EMPLOYEES
To really help employees in their work-life balance by truly managing workload and resources. for employees working at their most capacity, and even beyond that, keeping that for long period of time is hard.
Continue diversity and inclusion initiatives. Make sure concerns from all levels within the company are heard and act upon
Some parts of the organization are understaffed.  This leads to inefficiencies and delays.  I also believe that our inability to pay our vendors in a timely fashion creates a poor image for the company.
Please check politics and personal beliefs at the door.  The CEO does not speak for everyone at this company, and it is making it increasingly difficult for those of us who don't agree with everything that is said in the news media to continue to be proud to work for this company.  These public disclosures of opinion are not unifying, and are in fact dividing us as a country, let alone in our workplace.
Make sure the CRDs are following the processes and not encouraging use of extra trackers that are not part of the process.  My study also does not have a diversity challenge so we need to use the 37% and my CRD is making it challenging to recruit on the study so it is a fight between the clinical team vs the CRD on a challenging TA.
Look at the 24/7 operations and the pay. This is what keeps the company going after the discovery. You need to balance the pay with the union workers and management.
Become more diligent about total portfolio prioritization, and be willing to make tough decisions at the highest levels to stop some things (products, programs, projects).  We cannot continue to "do everything" and yet cut 25% from our budgets: working more efficiently will not cover that gap alone.
less talking, faster decision making, simplify the process
As part of of D & I provide equal opportunity to  all age groups
As many of us work from home, we have extra time before 9am and after 5pm which was previously commute hours. However, I don't feel any relief and my WLB getting worse, because I keep receiving meeting invitations, many of them regular weekly and daily request before 9am and after 5pm. It is hard to say no to such meetings, especially important ones. But I do hope the company can provide advice to everyone to respect prior 9am or 8:30am hours and only arrange meetings that are really essential.
Celebrate everyone who wants to do a good job at Merck -- not only the younger workers.  Older workers want to be part of diversity and inclusion also.
Continue to build on the diversity already established at Merck. Also continue adapting with today's needs.
Getting feedback, and listening to the difficulties of workers and revisit the concern - example: recent implementing of goggles for production area which is a good move of safety. However, the goggles fogged easily & when a person perspire the goggles interior collected sweat & its disturbing the person vision. In addition, it could be worst when the person is doing a chemical drum charge with gloves on or in full gear PPE.
Give opportunity for scientists on R route to grow as it is being given to M route.
Executive leadership should stop taking very public sides in politically divisive situations.  I come to work to work, not to continuously hear about politics.
Merck needs to promote from the bottom up.  Bringing people in based on degrees has proved useless in a lot of situations.
Leading by example at the senior leadership level. My functional manager does a good job of "walking the talk." However, my perception changes as I examine senior leadership.
Take a stronger stance on explicitly encouraging employees to get vaccinated. I realize it's a touchy subject with people who don't "believe" in vaccinations, but those of us who do trust science shouldn't be penalized by working with people who refuse to get vaccinated. I also realize this can't be strictly required for legal reasons, but it should be encouraged as strongly and explicitly as possible.
I love this company and it is a privilege to work here. I like that we are focusing on everyone's health and well being. Also, mentioning political issues that are important is a plus! Just overall love this company!!!
Please make sure to have plans for older employees still working at MERCK.  There is a great emphasis on making the merck place "younger"...this is good however for those that are older and still have alot to offer you must still ensure that they "feel valued" and that there is a place for us all.      '
MSD is really making an excellent job to continue being a great place to work. I have been in this company for just a few months and I am totally surprised with the amount of areas involved in employee training, improvement and satisfaction. MSD employee oriented vision is touching every single employee and manager.
1) Managers providing support for their people  and projects versus absorbed in promotion of company initiatives would be of great value. 2) Employees able to do their job well and being well-trained versus having to participate in various company workstreams and initiatives in order to get successful ratings.  Add to that these folks are usually hand picked for these opportunities versus the most qualified person for the job.  There is not equal opportunity for all.  1 example CRA only at Merck for 1 year who is now on a developmental plan to become a therapeutic area lead. What? I've not been given this opportunity.  3) Sites and employees are extremely frustrated with Merck company systems that don't work or are difficult, cumbersome, and techno challenging - SIP.  Implore Merck management if you want to be partner of choice, please stop rolling out systems that don't work and/or employees are expected to run, troubleshoot, and brainstorm everyday to do the job.
Prioritize. While the company continues to recognize there is no end to the race, this is a perpetual marathon, from my street corner we're back to running at sprint speed.  It may be unique to my position in a global role but I don't see prioritization.  I'm tired and the roadmap for the next 5 years looks like little opportunity to recover.
It seems like decisions are being pulled at higher levels versus being driven down to the appropriate level in the organization.  This reduces empowerment and job satisfaction.  It also draws management attention and time up, and away from coaching and developing their team, which is across and down.
Be more agile, more innovative  Less red tape for the promotional review process (PRT)   Transition the marketing teams from traditional teams to Marketing Agile Teams / Rapid Realization Teams/Digital Engagement Teams to be more innovative and more quicker with better quality
continue to recognize and reward efforts and service.
Be sure that the appropriate individuals are included on emails that are essential.
keep supporting D&I both at Merck and in the world.
Adjust pay to meet what our competitors compensate.  Get more field input into our resources.  Seems like CNN is influencing our daily work lives here at Merck.  We need less Politics as part of our workday.
use technology that works without many issues
Focus on creating innovative medical solutions that solve unmet needs.
Continue to grow when it comes to D&I.
Make sure that the top leaders, department heads, etc. of the company always remain politically neutral in what they say in their emails, what they say in person and over WebEx (and in the future, in person) meetings.
Continue recruiting diverse talent and being inclusive to them.
Improve the medical benefit and coverage
Developing future workplace environment through experimentation...how much longer are we able to keep up largely virtual environment?, when will we start seeing impacts/misses from current environment?.
Be clear on the long-term growth strategy and make the necessary decisions to make it happen, including resource realignment and talent incentive schemes
set an example as a responsible company and be vocal and take action (ie: ensure that merck does not (financially or otherwise) support politicians/policies who do not stand up against racial injustice, voter suppression). Ensure this company is always on the right side of history and not ambiguous.
Acquisitions.   Our product line and pipeline are getting thin.
Merck should focus on what we do and not take political sides.  If you take a political side, then you risk losing 50% of your revenue in the market.
Although the company has several initiatives to make the things different, we need to encourage people to be more prepositive and to thing different
Allow people to focus on critical priorities not everything that is a good idea. We say that we prioritize but we actually don't and we commit to new activities throughout the year.  We need an HR model refresh where HRBPs can re-contract with clients on what level of support to expect.  Our team is overwhelmed with work, projects, and new initiatives.  And the speed of completion expected has increased during the pandemic.  There's an assumption that you can turnaround a response or deliverable very fast.
Stabilize--avoid the "on the gas--off the gas rhythm of manufacturing" because of demand changes.  Set frozen periods where schedule/forecast can't be changed
collaborate, communicate & encourage employees to coordinate & work as a team
Enrich our pipelines, deliver more products for human health, make our company stronger.
Don't get political. We provide life saving medicine to all people of all backgrounds, thats our mission. Todays world is getting too political, we need to calm hot tempers and reunite our people, not fuel the divide. I already feel targeted by some of Merck's "inclusive" training but I understand the intent so i look beyond the microaggressions I feel are targeting me.
Create more remote opportunities to leverage the talent within the company.  Pick a clear direction and communicate well to help breakdown the silos that are starting to form. In the past we have worked really hard to work inclusively throughout our bu abs as we grow we are moving away from that and more into silos again despite all working in the same space
Ensure that everyone, regardless of who they are, where they come from, or what they believe are safe to be their authentic self at work.  I know the company is trying to ensure this, however, some voices are louder and more accepted then others.   Also, profit sharing with the employees, such as RSUs, is a real incentive and proves that Merck truly invests in their employees.
Drive sustainability, diversity and inclusion
Actively sponsor digital programs and projects with action, not just talk.  Have Leaders model the behaviors they want to see with digital projects, not just talk about them.  Continue the workplace flexibility provided during the pandemic, it's been a great way to achieve some work/life balance that me and my family really appreciate.
Continue to support a culture of support developing medicines to patients and providing access globally
Drive our business into a more automated environment
Accelerate a safe return to work process increasing socialization and improving professional collaboration
More focus on Prioritization of work.  Everything cannot be a priority.  We need to get better as an organization at saying "Not Yet."  People are getting burnt out from head count reductions which result in one person then having to take on the workload of two or more people.
- Change and adapt better and not change for change sake. -Be able to make changes and not have to roll out the same change to all department/visions as one size DOES NOT always fit all ...
make inclusion big...let people feel safe to speak up. Great a good place to feel supported and get developed.
The pandemic has obviously made things much more difficult for the Company and its leadership and that is understood.  But I think Merck should work on a working environment that promotes discussions across multiple areas.  This will bring colleagues closer together since it introduces a personal aspect to the business relationship that will be forged.  We always here from employees with many years of experience that one of the best things about Merck was the people they worked with and relationships they built along the way.   They rarely bring up the specific work events and initiatives they happen to be involved with.  That is why the Company needs to focus on its internal networking and culture amongst its employees.
Each department should have a budget line item for Administrative Professionals Education. This means courses or conferences geared towards the Administrative Professional.  There are many classes offered by Merck but none that are strictly dedicated to the Administrative Professional.  For example, a Project Management course geared towards the Administrative Professional or a particular certification.
The changes we are making right now are important, but we need more time to implement successfully.
Create clear guidelines and encourage work life balance  Provide tools and support to make home office comfortable and healthy  Promote healthy habits
Be more transparent with the cancelling of projects such as COVID related projects.
Treat people fairly.  No favouritism.  Everyone belongs.  Everyone brings value.
Improve benefit costs for employees with families.  The benefits have declined but the costs have gone up over the many years I have been at Merck.
diminish administrative/repetitive work to have more focus on essential tasks consider more job sharing also allowing part time workers personal development and amplifying horizon
1)  Ensure that the work we are doing is RELEVANT to the mission, and not just pushing puzzle pieces to the next open space. 2)  Too much use of cc: field of e-mail in hopes that the other person will do the work, independent that the other person or team isn't the right one anyway. 3)  We used to have a rule that said "3 ping-pong's on an e-mail was the max. permissible" and then a phone call or other "in person" communications was mandatory to resolve the topic.   Sadly, we see 20+ pings and pongs and nothing gets done by the right person.  Too many distribution lists are used, or non-person mail accounts that represent black holes or dead-mailboxes. 4)   Bring back ITOM v.2 - "Get me involved, get me involved early."   What happened to this?   Bringing "me" in at the last moment can't be tolerated any more.
Staying tuned to ever changing climate in external factors (eg Covid, physical and mental health of of employees and external factors that shape us.)
Please have senior leadership follow through on their support of a flexible work schedule and ensure that management follows through on that model.  Just becasue one works remotely, does not mean that they are not focused on continuing to bring value and getting a lot of meaning from their work.  Not everyone wants the distraction of being in the office.
Continue to innovate in sciences as well as in the ways of working (keeping an open mind about how to change what we are used to do). Focus on the well being (health related) of the people across culture and regions, including low income countries.
I am a women who just married last year. I think it would be good if MSD can provide more channel or tools to help working females balance the life and work. So, we don't need to worry about our family at the same time advancing the career. That would be wonderful.
Better connection between different platforms
We need more time and attention paid to:  - the amount of work people have on their plate - the number of hours per day people are working to get the job done - making sure we have enough staff to get the job done - evaluating what is added to daily work such a trainings or initiatives and making sure it does not over burden     people and add more stress
Nothing comes to mind.
Let's focus on being respectful of everyone but spend our energies at work on work things and leave personal agendas and politics for outside of work hours.
Accelerate the digital tools implementation
- Communicate how work places will change post pandemic / be open to different type of work arrangements  - Stop planning so much (too much time invested in forecasting) and be more focus on flawless execution - More long term view rather than just short term approach
Align salaries and bonuses with the work performed and strive to be competitive with similar companies as Merck does at the executive level.   Promote based on the best candidate with the most experience, strengths, skills versus arbitrary corporate goals on  genders, races, sexual orientations, religions unrelated to the position.
Continue what they are doing.
Focus on people, especially our employees; understanding the global culture/diversity instead of being US-focused
Focus on making decisions faster.  Need to truly embrace work-life balance.  We are working crazy hours because of the Organon spin-off.
Continues working with MSP principles to be applied to MMD processes and alignment between divisions to be more efficient
Work life balance that we can work from home . appreciation on employee eg certificate , reward
Perhaps by being more transparent. Less focus on metrics- they only tell part of the story. For example, the metrics for volume of product generated does not take into account the costs at which those numbers were accomplished. More balance between quality and quantity.
Employees should be asked for feedback, but the MSD culture is not to inform upper managers because it has consequences, better to write "everything is perfect" and to discuss serious problems among us. Sincerely, no idea what to do other than change company
I believe Merck has lot of resources to address the world's most urgent needs. Therefore, the company could engage more in various collaborations with NGOs (as we do for example through Fellowship for Global Health) or could launch more support programs similar to Mectizan Donation Program. Also, it would be awesome if there would be more ways to contribute to these collaborations/programs for Merck/MSD people from all around the globe (I work in IT, I am based in Czech Republic, and I am not aware of more possibilities than Fellowship for Global Health).
Endeavour to remove the barriers that slow us down. We need to be a speed boat not an oil tanker. Sometimes I feel we are way to cautious. Simplify the language within the SOPs sometimes SOPS contain contradictions. Could I take this opportunity to thank the UK LT they have been incredible throughout this pandemic. I have never felt so connected and a part of this incredible company.
Sufficient IT resources to enable digitization. Our leaders want us to accelerate digitization, but my impression is that IT resources are being reduced.
Add more meeting rooms, or telephone rooms, set up mobile office spaces.
I think a really careful look at our internal systems from a user perspective and ensure there is seamless and easy to user journey for compliance, anti-corruption and material review so that meeting our obligations to audit and warrant our ethics is as easy and quick as it can be. Currently I would say on a pure systems level more than half of my productive time is sunk into managing systems to do that rather than the job I am here to do. Often it leads us to reject undertaking the best course of action because we know it is undeliverable merely due to the amount of time and difficulty of navigating MSD systems involved.  The other thing MSD could do is really look hard at the language it uses especially when communicating with patients and patient organisations - I feel we need to strive for simplicity and empathy in communication more than we do and not trample over the emotional reaction the lexicon we use as an organisation has in pursuit of perfect and full factual disclosure.
Renovations made to have departments all in one building.  Invest in the lab infrastructure.
empowering, psycological safety
Local leaders should encourage Global and Regional meetings that overlap with meal times to be seen at another time. Also Global and Regional leaders should avoid long meetings (3 / 4 hours).
Reconsider the open office concept. It does not work for all personality types.
When working on project, allowing more time to test. Let us test for months not just a 2 or 3 months before going live. This will help avoid us from missing information and it will help us catch more errors. If  information gets missed it'll be too late to add it to the new system and it causes more stress/work on everybody.
Provide better compensation for those that have been with the company longer.
Value all employees.  Although each employee's contributions to a project may not be known or visible, the work they do matters.  People who handle the day to day activities keep the company running too.  These employees should be recognized too.
focus on people, how we can better support and develop capability
During a pandemic, Merck should allow an employee's spouse to be utilized for the Backup Child Care option. There are instances where the parents may not need to quarantine but the child does (example: child was exposed to COVID at daycare). It is unreasonable to ask someone outside of the immediate family to provide childcare for your child and put them at risk for contracting COVID. Without this option, many parents need to find ways to work from home and take care of their child at the same time which can result in not high quality work or mistakes made.   Vaccination clinics for the COVID vaccine should be held on site like we do for the flu shot. We should set an example to the rest of our local community.
Take non-value added work i.e. numerous governance reviews for decisions.  Better work/life balance.  The amount of work on people's plate is always above 100%.
I don't believe that our company is just a great place to work but rather a fantastic, wonderful, caring, and far exceeds any company I have worked for or with in my career.  My only thought on room for improvement could be in the area of vendor management.  Too often the bigger, most known vendor receives the contract when there are many smaller companies that provide a niche service.  I find that when we work with the large companies like SAP, there isn't accountability on the vendor part.  There should be penalties for missed delivery dates and not just a slap on the wrist. Basically all vendors should have skin in the game to help us deliver on promises to our leadership team and ultimately our patients. I appreciate being given the opportunity to provide feedback to move us from GREAT to FABULOUS!
continue to do what they are doing...challenging the status Quo
Merck is a great company with a great culture. We have excellent products and an excellent pipeline and are well positioned for the future. This goes along way towards employee retention, but Merck needs to offer competitive compensation to avoid employees feeling that they are being taken advantage of. The entire industry will see a major turnover of people in the next 5 years. Attracting and keeping the right people will be a challenge in a very competitive market unless we consider changes.
Focus on what we do and our business
Quit micromanaging things and listen to the people who do the work to get the resources we need to do the job not waiting on things everyday
Offer RSUs to employees for future investment into the company.
I just started working at Merck within the past year.  I have been thoroughly impressed with the caliber of colleagues.  I feel like conversations are smart and driven. I like this feeling.  I haven't been on-site yet, but do get a sense that some of the systems and processes seem old fashioned.  Built for a previous generation. I feel like refreshing some thinking could help jump start the next phase at Merck.
Look at not really needed functions. There are a lot of expensive global postions that don't add any value. The new world is decentralized. That strategy would more likely assure the future of the company than the traditional centralized way including "strategical" cross functions that, again, don't add any value
I feel Inspire points are available to award an employee/co-worker/manager/who-ever it may be for many things, one which includes a complicated task or completed audit that was done well. After personally completing several of such activities, my manager has not rewarded me a single Inspire point or Thank you since 2017.  I on the other hand have made to send Inspire pts to coworkers that have assisted me to complete a job. I feel there is not equal footing among management when it comes to "Thanking/Rewarding" employees.
Reduce burocracy, Facilitate production, Reduce safety documentation
Stock not just for specific levels or for such a few set of people.
Provide support on IT projects that will have positive impact, it seems we have to continue to justify time and time again and sacrifice, do workarounds, etc. when in the broader aspect it is costing more to do these work arounds and the quality and long-term data security are sacrificed.
Merck and MSD needs to start acting like a leader and ensuring there are sufficient resources to be a leading healthcare company. Instead of increasing work load and stress levels for employees, do more with much less. Career development needs to be taken more seriously and rewarding high performing loyal Merck employees vs. taking advantage of those who haven't come from other companies or jumped ship with lower compensation and less rapid promotions etc.  Look to provide small items to increase employee pride, i.e. could have provided Merck branded masks during COVID and other Merck items (hats,sweaters, t-shirts etc.)  Highlight phenomenal initiatives like Merck Fellowship for Global Health, Merck for Mothers etc.
Decision making processes need to be evaluated.
MSD should focused on people development and capability enhancement.
Analyzing competitor movement related to similar therapeutic area with ours, develop the strategy to make our product be the first line for patient, supported by affordable price and good quality. Develop the skill for employee that suit with strength in order to achieve the goals based on employee role
Work on improving the collaboration between and within functions.
Insuring adequate resources (people) are available. We continue to ask for more and more to be done with fewer and fewer people and the expectations and demands from some leaders (at all levels) sometimes reach in terms of times and timing.
Merck and MSD is always taking actions to make the company a great place to work.
I think the company should encourage more flexible work arrangements as we free ourselves from COVID.
stop changing the HeadQuarters location
I appreciate that Ken was a public, visible CEO...meaning he participated in policy discussions and was an outspoken advocate of injustices.  He is/was a CEO that I am/was proud be to represented by.  I hope Rob can continue in that manner.  I appreciate the way that Ken took the role of the CEO to another level.  It became a good platform.  It is pretty awesome that a young generation recognizes and appreciates our CEO for more than healthcare.  My children are learning about Merck in college classes!
Continue supporting individuals in their growth within the company. Something I appreciate about Merck that stands out above other companies is the involvement of management in my personal goals, and their willingness to help me personally get there, rather than just me being a face in the crowd that completes tasks. My department does an amazing job at this, and this is something that has engaged me and made me want to stay with Merck for a long time. Keep up the great work BCMT leadership!!!
Increase recruitment from outside of the industry, particularly in areas like Data and Analytics and Digital Transformation where many other industries have progressed these information sciences well beyond where the pharmaceutical industry has taken them.
Keep up the great work!
Less walk on the left walk on the right ! covid has been an excuse to go over the top re small controls that are irritating.to people personally. its not life and death but is irritating and grates when it does not need to.
Strive to be most admired company to work for by its people.
Talk to the people that work for you that have the knowledge or it directly affects them before decisions are made.
Merck could pace up a little bit in not only digitization but also personal development.
Focus on ensuring team members have appropriate resources to get work done effectively; work life balance is more challenging than ever since the lines between work life and home life are blurred
Improved software systems use to reduce  paperwork and efficient processes ( Work Orders education). Further  focus on team members  development to accommodate further progression within the company. No time for team building  learning more about  colleagues and  their interests, just a focus on targets and time lines.
Ensure that message of inclusions are running throughout all levels of the organisation. It is received well with the Leadership but can get lost at mid-level managers.
MSD is a company that has been constantly downsizing. It's hard to feel positive about the workplace when less and less headcount is recorded. Comparing to other pharmaceutical companies, there's a very low growth potential. This impacts career progression and morale. There needs to be greater focus on getting products to market and growing the business.
Build a strong leadership to lead and identify the right talent to work.
Decision should be based on data and evidence rather than intuition.
Improve internal processes like in procurement, HR, finance, customer service and logistics
Create a culture where everyone can speak without fear and take care of there employees in terms of family and work life balance .
Promote Feedback Culture and Growth Mindset
Address unfair practices in career paths / biased senior leaders
Merck and MSD is really good place to work as it is people oriented and with safe environment. I would really like to improve the decision making capabilities. Decisions should be made fast and appropriate.
set up a workweek where there is at least one day with teleconferences
Consider remote working hubs at appropriate locations to accommodate groups. This could address issues around isolation for those working from home, help attract and keep talent from wider regional areas, manage COVID risks and shorter commute would contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions.
Stay in contact with the employees. For instance; give clear and understandable feedback on the outcome of this survey and actions that may follow.
Electronic batch record, automation of repetitive work circumstances, Long term commitment and stability balanced with short term opportunities.
Need to help the above site teams "walk in the shoes" of the plants. QSIP has been a huge challenge.  We rolled out the program years ago with a dedicated staff.  Then we took the dedicated staff away b/c it was too expensive and asked the sites to do their day job and implement.   As the organization pulled people away to do other work - COVID hit and QSIP still implemented a few topics and expects to pick up again in 2021.  This initiative has caused more churn, frustration, unplanned events (QNs).  It is also extremely risky that we don't ask anyone to physically train on the procedures we have established (I'm still not sure how to explain that to a regulator.)  We get Quality Management System updates almost daily which shows a lack of control over the global system.  To me this further demonstrates instability in our global Quality System. Finally, Digital solutions are not always the answer.  GLIMS has been extremely painful to implement.
make our processes more streamline and easier. remove silos between MRL and HH. Aling on other's pharma companies procedures without creating barriers to implement innovative and valuable initiatives for our customers.
Embrace working from home wherever possible and flexible options around it
Provide enough human resources, so that employees can have work life balance, and redesign the Compensation Plan with amount salary increase grids, instead of %, as a % applied to a low salary will always result in a low increase, meaning a low salary range for many years.
Inclusive leaders, current managing director of my market is not a prolific leader and I believe it has taken down the momentum of the company. I also believe MSD should continue to put patients first. And finally MSD should strive towards thinking beyond the pill and ensuring digital development and medical review is enhanced and promoted.
- continue invest in talent/ people - be more competitive compensation and benefit for key talents - balance resource allocation between onco and other TA (as in some countries other TA still the biggest revenue driver) - more investment to innovative ideas
I believe it will be great in the future to work in the office and from home as well as working from home for me had increased my performance.
continue to evaluate synergies across the organization and transform to realize the benefits of these synergies  continue to attract talent - by providing competitive compensation packages continue to remain flexible to allow team members to juggle the pressures outside of work (especially through the pandemic)
I think the company is doing a day by day work on this and we are in a better position than some years ago
Better leadership, transparency/communication, cross-functional connections, and support for employees. Merck/MSD is tackling a lot. My suggestion would be to cut the "nice to haves" or focus it in a very specific way by launching focus tams (rather than requesting the "nice to have" broadly), and then direct focus on the "need to haves" that will bring benefit. This will reduce employee stress, too, because at the moment we are being spread thin, and that doesn't make much sense from a business perspective or a human health perspective (if we are compromising the health of our employees) nor does it bode well for retention. While it is great to innovate and get things done in new/better ways, it is often a waste because someone else has automated the task without sharing. In addition to sharing, gaining credit for the innovation (negative politics, rather than collaboration) gets in the way and lessens the value of innovation.
Provide flexibility of being in or out of the office.  Continue to provide updates on where the company is headed.
Full time remote working arrangements should not only be allowed but encouraged. Unless absolutely critical to your job function (like running experiments in a lab), no one should be required to come into the office. The health benefits go well beyond staying safe from COVID. The common flu spreads in the office environment every year. Many employees feel like it is a badge of honor to come into the office even when sick to show their dedication to the company. I personally don't feel safe coming back into a crowded office environment, even with reduced occupancy.
Continue the dialogue - where the company is headed, our priorities, any shifts (external/internal).  It's nice to hear from our senior leaders especially when working from home - makes me feel more connected with where we are going as a company.
Avoid employee burnout with so many simultaneous meetings and calls from different teams and divisions.
Keep providing updates and where the company is growing
It would be reassuring to hear more about the pipeline with the top new products we see coming in the next 1, 3, 5 years. This is a question that often comes up at the EBB and is usually answered with 1 or 2 therapies coming forward, but a more comprehensive, illustrated slide depicting a broader, inclusive portfolio would be appreciated.
I feel like they should keep personnel working remotely to ensure safety of all the employees. It has been proven that the jobs can be done working remotely and the business hasn't failed due to not having them on site like it was before the pandemic. I feel like more personnel have been able to work more efficiently and be more productive since we all started working remotely. There is no rush to send everyone back because this pandemic is far from over and we still need to ensure everyone is safe.
I think we should have more surveys like this and measurements of our employee morale. I think there are a lot of different opinions that fluctuate throughout the year due to changes experienced throughout the year so having a continuous pulse on how people feel more than just annually can be very beneficial. More information is always better to make better informed decisions.
Have managers handle conflicts more and follow through.  Accountability on the job employees perform.  To many things get over looked and just seems to have an "oh well" effect.
I think the only thing can be better is that we need  more communication with Upper management
Consider employee work life balance. Reduce process.
More resources (employees) to reduce the amount of work per individual
Emphasize more on science; quicker process and decision making to be more adaptable and nimble.
make better step for a good work life balance
I think the channels to speak up about racism and other types of discrimination must be strengthen, most of the time we simply keep our comments to ourselves and accept many forms of discrimination just because they are part of others' "culture". I also think some areas should work harder on making their collaborators feel valued and that will allow to retain the talent that might otherwise go after a different offer (even if only related to higher payment).
Make work from home standard for those that are not essential to be present to manufacture product. Expand the flexibility to work from home. I am extremely more efficient working from home than driving to the site. Continue to foster an inclusive work environment, reinforce the 12 inclusive behaviors.
develop more drugs other than keytruda
While I believe it is important to focus on the youth for the future, I sometimes feel the more experienced employees are often overlooked for their opinions.
When able to do so, have more face-to-face events and activities to help build the sense of belonging. Working remotely, and having hired many new staff, now requires extra effort to bring people together.
MSD must continue with the work and mission of keeping its patients with the best therapies and continue to support its collaborators, continue with all that they have given us in support of professional and personal growth.  Just thanks to MSD from my family and me
Helping employee to achieve work life balance. Start with helping staffs to reduce travelling time to and fro work.
Better onboarding for new employees coming from outside of Merck
Be less conservative and risk-averse: (i) Better use of our vast wealth of clinical data to inform Discovery efforts; (ii) Less worrying about IP when drafting agreements with collaborators/CROs in the discovery space - time is more important than the very low chance valuable IP will be generated!
Review the CVs and make sure salary is fair. Encourage more work from home abilities in 2022 and 2023.
Merck does a great job at being transparent about the portfolios.   Since Merck stepped out of the Covid race, I would like to know what else is on the horizon for Merck.   There are adjustments happening within the portfolio and it will be important for us all to know if there are impacts from this.
It would be great to see concrete steps to ensure diversity and inclusion at the CTT level. It is important for the CTT to be open to insights from the country teams since they are closer to the pulse of our sites in an ever evolving standard of care. The old standards keep evolving and the country teams see this evolution and so it is important for the MRL CTT to be open to feedback coming from medical teams in the local country.
Value the hospital team to greater extent
Please change management in HO . Those who know products, ground level work who worked in field who is having good grip in market. Mainly product manager who can take suggestions from field employees and he should work in field now a days we are missing this type of mangers. Who take suggestions. Only they order and also they give task to finish in two days . In two days how is it possible when we covering lot of geographic customers....? If any thing we implement it take time first we do survey we take feed back then implications happen. Here Product managers are dominating due to this there is huge loss in budget and focus on customers sir.  Give best environment to field workers because if we work freely then we do many miracles and we alll field workers almost more than 10 years of experience. We know how to handle the business and situations.
I am proud to work for a company that has always supported diversity and inclusion.  However, the recent emphasis on diversity seems to focus on pointing out our differences.  I believe we are all much more alike than different and focusing on perceived differences is not beneficial to individuals or the company as a whole.  Additionally, over the last 1-2 years, Merck leadership has become vocal on politics which polarizes and alienates those with different political beliefs.  Leadership should not voice their personal political opinions and Merck should never support one position over another on a national level (e.g. Georgia voting laws), unless the topic is related to pharmaceutical companies.  Our focus should always be on patients - to save and improve lives.
Take a step back on implementing so many changes so quickly and allow groups to be able to absorb changes before adding new work to the already strained system.
Remove the performance review process, too political, plays favorites to those most "exposed" to the people approving the ratings.
Need better alignment on objectives and culture between Commercial teams and shared services (e.g., PRT, IT Capabilities).
Our mission should not be any part of a political platform. Our mission should be to serve our customers. Right now our customers don't feel like that. The next steps we take as a company should be to uphold our values, and our customers values and do what is best for them to better serve them.
Merck needs to focus on D&I but not simply by saying it is a priority but doing more. There also needs to be greater accountability in all hiring for this, as well as when promotions are considered.
Company does a great job already.
Continue focused on our vision of inventing and delivering those inventions to the patients
I'm glad there haven't been layoffs and that the Company has been supportive of working remotely, providing updates on the pandemic and having resources available to help employees cope with stress during these trying times. But I feel like all the Company cares about is getting younger. And I've worked so hard the past year but feel senior management cares more about the status of the stock than making sure I'm recognized and rewarded for my accomplishments and that I'm replaceable.
Bring employees ' salaries to the average market values
continue to evolve, become more digital internally, find the right balance between travel and virtual meetings. Virtual meetings are extremely productive, time saving, less tiring and cost efficient
New software tools are available and in use. Training for colleagues on these would improve their effectiveness. They are usually left to teach themselves.
1) Enhance people performance assessment
Keep it simple in process and structure.
I think in general that the HR policies that are created for the company as a whole don't take into account people who work shifts (12 hours across 7 days a week), so it can be unfair. This leads good workers to not want to take shift work (and the pay isn't incentive enough, especially for working nights), which causes the shift leadership positions to be difficult to fill with skilled workers. For example, the 4th of July was on a Saturday in 2020, which meant that Merck recognized the 3rd of July as a holiday instead. But what that meant for shift workers was that people who worked on the ACTUAL holiday of the 4th of July received no holiday pay. Or that salaried shift leads receive no time off compensation for Merck holidays that take place on their days off.
Look for additional strategies to balance work/Family life, since sometimes is difficult.
Right size Oncology
I like that we emphasize that it isn't just about what we do but that how we do it matters just as much.  I think we should craft our metrics in such a way that we avoid "Ill-Conceived Goals" which would promote unethical behavior.
Continue following science and don't fall into political traps.
Keep caring about their employees
We all need to get on the "same page" and work towards the same "goal", from high level to the individual contributors.  I think the goal and message gets lost in middle management.  Also we need to start having some accountability and consistency.  How expectations, processes, procedures, skills, awards, promotions, etc are applied depends on the person, who their manager is and their connections. This leads to a lot of confusion and inefficiencies.
I believe the current executive leadership has made clear the vision and direction we should all be working toward.  A critical step is for all of us to align and ensure individual priorities and work at the department levels do not impede our reaching our overall company goals and objectives.  Too often we get caught up in our specific roles and objectives because of our organizational structure which makes it difficult to prioritize the most important work.
To be focused in our priorities
Balance work, priorities and allow time for innovation.
Keep it up! Employees
APPLY THE VACCINE TO ALL OF THEIR WORKERS
The organization, searchability, and accessibility of quality documents is not only embarrassing, but in direct conflict with the companies desired compliance culture. Too many individuals don't know how to find what documents govern their work, and even when they do, they often struggle to search for them or access them.  People are encouraged to speak up when they see opportunities for improvement, but often all of the time/effort to exact change falls on the individual which can overwhelm people and prevent them from speaking up in the future. Management could improve how they recognize and support potentially impactful ideas for change.
Find ways to help staff with workloads -  the workloads are increasing but headcounts decreasing - often can add to a lot of stress, working after of hours and taking away from family time.
When the world returns to "normal", do not stop the D&I as well as the mental health and work/life balance focus and emphasis!
Transparency Motivation Rewarding
Improve the flexible working, work remotely
Continuity with our customers, multiple changes of territory, indication,  manager changes .Most important is that our customers dislike these changes, relationships cannot just be transferred,  or learnt on a business plan , there is a  lack of customer confidence you would not be around for long.... so why invest in us?
Empower employees
In MMD, finish the work begun to update the QMS.  It is so disjointed right now to have the Quality manual in pieces for so long.  Continue to support families working from home.
Actively prioritize strategic initiatives.  It feels like everything is a priority.  Most initiatives are highly complex and many are interdependent on each other, stretching resources across too many workstreams rather than sequencing work to build strong foundations.  Too many meetings prevents ability to get the work done and requires significant work on evenings and weekends, deteriorating work/life balance.  Also, consider optimizing the use of agile teams or principles.  Many teams are "agile" now and the overhead of ceremonies every two weeks fills up calendars and limits the time for productive work.  Agile is good but needs better balance.
LA BUROCRACIA ES MUY MUY MUY FARRAGOSA.  ESCUCHAR  AL PERSONAL QUE TIENE QUE REALIZAR EL TRABAJO Y  CONTAR CON ESE PERSONAL PARA PLANEAR COMO  HACERLO MUCHA JERARQUIA, MUCHOS MANDOS INTERMEDIOS IDEAS POCO CLARAS PARA QUIEN TIENE QUE EJECUTAR
1. Provide a road map for development and advancement. 2. Have a public forum for 'gigs' or other opportunities, other than workday or delve, maybe in the B53 corridor.
Merck needs to be a better communicator of the value it brings to patients and communities, and be more vocal against uninformed negative communications. Our external communications are so poor, I want to see good stories in the news, I want the public to be more aware of the good that Merck does, because there is a lot of good but nobody knows about it except us
Communicate interim thoughts on future of teams whose senior leaders depart.  External Benchmarking of job titles and bonus structures to be more competitive
Be mindful of the amount of work which is put in the system at the same time. Really allow people to take vacation without  being online during vacation.
Increased acceptance of working from home could allow more flexibility in school holidays, curriculum days etc.  Ensure part timers are treated like they are valued. I have had several comments about being "only part time", "you would never be considered for this position because you are only part time", "had meetings deliberately scheduled out of my work hours" by full timers to exclude me etc. I don't even report it any more as nothing was ever done. If you are part time being expected to do the same amount of work for less pay is not fare. With childcare expenses so high the pay rate needs to reflect expenses these days. Clearer career development for those that have at home responsibilities too. Value staff and try to retain them. Increase it is safe to speak up culture. Much better HR, return to work system needs a complete overhaul as it is a tick box. Genuine support for injured workers and those with children.
team work and together towards the goals of company
Empower the employees to speak up their mind and be themselves, Be creative.  Invest in employee well-beings so that they would feel sense of belonging and ownership.
Work out guidelines on supporting home based employees so let them have a feeling of belonging of Merck & MSD.
Allowing certain extent of localisation and taking opportunities from local market
Supporting team
- Simple and easy process - New job profiles/roles - Transparency  - Competent/experienced leaders - Job profile : Should be according to relevant experience/competency
Managers to have a better vision, and realistic executable strategies, and better alignment among cross functional divisions, implement realistic balance in work-personal life not only for formality
Extend employee benefit and remuneration programs
Hire more people to get the job done right rather than rushing
Bring IT and Science close together Allow more resources for exploratory and small demand project Allow bottom up approaches to drive innovation
We are on the right direction!!!
To be transparent to employes
An improved role specific training plan, including a robust onboarding process and checklist. Also focus on how  professionalism in the workplace is defined and demonstrated.
1. In country engagements we need more of them and must be interactive.  Strategy of the company being presented more to the whole company so that every one understand their role in implementing the strategy and achieving it. Every department need to also be strategy focused and measure every quarter how far they are to strategy what the barriers and the wins are   More collaborative working  Leadership engagements and mentorship programmes needs to be visible and their successes celebrate. Leadership to try be visible in this digital times
Ensure Merck Leadership behaviors are embraced and embody all leaders above director across the organization.  Drive an empowering culture to ensure success and job satisfaction across the organization.
Help employees in mantain a good work-life balance. Be more rigurous to everyone respect a short work day on fridays for example.
The Company is doing a stellar job in encouraging, growing and accelerating young talent and young people generally.   May be they could also recognise the contributions to the company of the older and more experienced people working in the lower echelons of the hierarchy - this group can feel overlooked, ignored and sidelined.
Continue to provide flexible work arrangements, including flexible work hours and remote work options.
Ensure R&D and our pipeline are able to sustain continued growth
Help to manage work/life balance and continue to try and reward people in other ways especially in times where morale is lower because performance is not as high and stress is high.
Promote employees to next level by assessing talents, contributions to Book of business and to team, and scientific knowledge.
Prioritize programs to enable innovation and development of new modalities.
Reward the people who stay with the company rather than the ones who leave and come back.  People want to feel valued by their dedication to the company.
leadership is often out of touch with the work teams do or the impacts of their decisions on team members
Truly focus on talent development and retention
Value your employees and the hard work they do.
Invest more into competitive salaries for employees.
Focus on our people and our products. Avoid political opinions.
Continue to implement ways to recognize and reward employees and remain competitive with the industry
Merck and MSD needs to recognize people who have been working here for a long time and promote them accordingly to avoid clashes within the team and entire workforce in a department
Establish HR policy which requires 6 core hours a day to support business functions and allows flex time the other 2 required hours.
Get rid of email as the primary communication tool.  Reduce the total number of communication tools supported (email, MS teams, yammer, spark, in-scope, sharepoint, on and on and on) - information overload.
Treat MSD & contract workers as equals and to be a bit more hesitant when it comes to terminating employees contracts based on one individuals opinion. A little bit more compassion and investigation would go along way.
Listen to it's employees.  Continue to let employees work from home even after things get better.  We have proven it can be done efficiently.
listen to suggestions and potential enhancements to processes and be flexible when applicable
Continue to evaluate and look for products to compliment our pipeline.
Come with more new products and idea to add revenue to company as well to us in way of healthy incentives
Provide opportunities to deserving candidates across different markets including developing markers.  for leadership positions.
To introduce new product & the new indication of the existing product at earliest for the Indian Business.
Train people effectively. Introduce teamwork. Remove Inspire rewards, as it is not equally shared and is now repeating what went before it.
Invest more in user friendly IT systems that really "speak with each other" and are fit for purpose. This would reduce the amount of useless time spent on tracking lists and reduce manual work and associated errors.
Everything is good their is no requirement of improvement,company very good support in this pendimic situation from continue last year.
Continue on the current path.
Continue to actively sponsor/support flexibility, even after the COVID crisis passes.  Last fall I was in a virtual conference and people were asked to rate our company's response - I was so pleased to rate the company as 10/10 after some thought.  The future Ways of Working will need to remember the ability we had to adapt as needed!
Simplify CRA processes. Some of the processes are very tedious and take time away from site management and monitoring ie CLMS. Also, more transparency around salary ranges.
Greater openness, there are many ways to reach a result, revalue young talent
New products to introduce that increase business and maintain sustainability
Take care of the employees working in the factories instead of all the focus on employees working remotely.
Understanding the progress and great scientific achievements can only be made if the overall infrastructure is in place and upkept long-term. By infrastructure meaning 1) analytical, chemical and general lab equipment, 2) proper functioning IT at work and at home (for WFH) 3) proper knowledge capture about workflows, safety and equipment use.  Scientist waste a lot of time on a day to day basis because little focus is given to these areas compared to the scientific achievement that can be immediately celebrated internally during end of the year evaluations or on social media. With a proper infrastructure, scientist would be better able to adapt to the ever increasing speed of programs.
from my point of view, MSD is considered success and best company i ever work with.  having always providing channel for employee to aspire so that  top management can consider as part of  decision making to improve a great plac to work and delivere on our mission. I think the bottom line from employee is always provided chance to have work life balance  (Time  balance, Involvement Balance,  satisfaction balance) is  key to sustain.  strategy to achieve work life balance:  1. provide flexible working hour 2. strive for normal working hour if possible, reduce over work. 3. access to childcare service if family really needed by employee. 4. work arrangement flexibility  to match with employee condition 5. allow employee to take daily leave. 6. security/safey and welfare
Continue to improve employees' wellbeing, more employee-centric initiatives and roll outs
Evaluate the current workload of employees. There seems to be a number of employees feeling stressed due to the current workload and number of hours required to try and manage it.
Continue to permit work from home (WFH) to a reasonable extent
I feel that the company overestimated the savings that would be driven by the Organon spin, and that has placed the company into a massive cost constraint mode to try and achieve these savings. This is causing huge stress within the organization and distracting people from their core job. It would be better (in my opinion) to acknowledge the targets were not achievable and reset to realistic ones
Provide training for administrative staff
It is still unclear to me how some people are promoted in my department, particularly those who have challenging workplace personalities that can undermine a team-based culture. There seems to be a lot of middle men involved in the leadership chain. Although I have a great manager now, there are many politics in place, and I don’t always feel safe to speak up with other leadership.
Merck has to really listen their employees to get better and make this company a great place to work. Employees are still not comfortable to give their opinion because they fear possible reprisals. That has to change.
Too many silos in the organization, and too many individuals acting in silos.  Not My Job is too common of a theme.  As a result, too many people are needed to review, approve, execute.  Eliminate current management structure and replace with flat organization and empowered work teams and individuals.  Instead of punishing people for thinking outside their box, people should be empowered and encouraged to expand their reach.  Under the current systems, you need to hire more people to deliver on mission.  Under empowerment, people can get more done without resorting to more resources.  Check out the Oz Principles or similar.
Actively involving production operators in improvement projects that concerns them by working with them to find out how exactly the intended project fits into the actually operations on the floor, instead of solely relying on theoretical plans. Thanks
Continue allowing the flexibility of working remotely to improve efficiency and the well-being of the employees
I’m happy working for MSD. The way this company takes care of us employees, customers and patients really show compassion. Prioritizing our safety during typhoons or national disasters. The way MSD handled this pandemic made me even more amazed. We are the first one to suspend our employees from going out of the field. The rest followed. That alone exhibited our companies  exemplary decision making. I also love how MSD maintains ethical standards when engaging with our customers despite the left and right unethical ways of other pharmaceuticals. This makes me proud to be part of a company that has continued to grow while adhering to our values and standards.
MSD is a great co. to work and great product for our customers. Need to improve robust  unique product pipeline to overcome pandemic situation like this.  Local leadership also see that  no one should bias either conscious or unconscious.
Diversity and inclusion ad per what have told repeatedly is not practice that well in this branch of MSD i guess. Promotion and project always goes to those who close with management.
Alot of benefit has been removed
nothing
To keep on exerting efforts on simplifying processes and listening to the feedback from employees on regular basis.
support learning and create opportunities
Find a way to improve the employees mental health due to the new challenging working from home
To challenge all initiatives which make MSD focus on even more internal work instead of external work. To make Empowerment come true, everything does not need to be checked/approved all the time.  Be forward looking when it comes to development of diseases, therapeutic areas. Focus on the great unmet medical need in Neurology. Don't rely on too few products.
Simplify business processes.There are to many systems to control other systems which must be completed, our work ends up being to filling systems to simplify the work of others people and this doesn't benefit the own work, In fact, remains little time to perform the tasks of the position.
Continue to transform process and remove roadblocks.  Identify root cause issues and do not implement quick fixes to resolve problems
Adequately resource the plant - too many people required to over extend themselves daily/on a constant basis. People are required to work beyond what they can comfortably sustain without any scope to react to upset scenarios.
Improve the compensation system to make sure employees feel fairly valued vs. long-term Merck employees usually are undervalued comparing to external hires and they are penalized for their loyalties.
Promote key talent within the organization and compensate competitively, not a blanket 10% raise.   This will result in someone taking an external opportunity and leaving Merck.
Allow the option to work from home permanently.
Personally, I like working with data and improving operations/supply chain by analyzing data. Currently Merck data is siloed, and should be more centralized.  Also, in my department we are paying contractors to do visualization work for us, which limits our ability to make business improvements and visualizations if we don't have it in the budget.  My time with GE they had a large incentive to centralize all their data, and the empower employees to find, analyze, and create datasets and visualizations that made significant improvements to the business.  It could be that I don't run in the right circles at Merck, but it seems that data management and knowledge is siloed and not a priority for the business.
Encourage from he top down, that just because this is the way we have always done it, doesn't meant there is not room to transform and make better.
Greater opportunities for rotations, opportunities to rotate into other groups to expand skill sets.
Hire folks who are the most qualified for the job.
Try not to take frustration out on middle managers and bench employees
I consider Merck a good place to work; and great at speaking out publicly on issues such a voting rights and racial injustice, of late. Compensation and promotion opportunities as compared (at least perceived) to others limited my "great" ranking. Likewise loss of office space to current open seating situation (and only once prompted adjustments for pandemic). Work-life balance concerns/occasional stress with understaffed group, but colleagues within group are part of what make work experience great. Silos between organization, especially the higher up you go, remain a big company problem, IMHO. Much more to say, but that's probably enough for now--overall, satisfied and enjoy working with my immediate colleagues.
COVID-19 showed that MSD and GCTO can deliver during challenging times even working in a fully remote regime. Now, for some countries the epidemic slowed down and company offices are opening for employees. From one side it is a good opportunity to return back to the office however at the same time it is quite challenging to switch from the home-base regime (the current format of working from home should be changed and it requires a big portion of employees flexibility). The proposal is to make for MSD employees a new regime of working that will combine both office/home office options (50%/50%) depending on employee flexibility. This will be a very supportive for employees.
Not just say inclusion but practice it with more communication between teams and "watching out" for other teams to ensure they are also following a good MPS process. This is instead of pointing fingers. I have always noticed that this MSD site has little teaching skills and is just now focusing on bettering training. Maybe it was just me being different that I felt excluded and gained less background information on how things work and not having a mentor "buddy" to feel free and safe to ask questions did not help.  -Increase training intensity and Structure training to be with a knowledgeable mentor -More team building activity across different groups who interact.
Continue the drive for inclusion. Identify priorities and if a project falls outside of those priorities it is evaluated to see if "now" is the right time to execute.
The better the pipeline and our products, the better the atmosphere will be! MSD is a great place to work with a lot of talented people.
I think Merck has a problem with bureaucracy and red tape.  Efforts to save money in procurement are not well researched and take a toll on R&D as we try to overcome hurdles to get the supplies and equipment we need.  Probably the greatest threat to Mercks success is its out of control EHS department who makes it almost impossible to work here.  It's not clear whether Merck has a safety problem or not as humans are fragile in design and are prone to having health issues.  It's what keeps us in business.  What is clear is that the huge growth in the EHS budget, bureaucracy and the time each individual loses each day due to restrictions imposed in the guise of safety has not improved safety at the site at all.  The data is freely available from the EHS website.  Corporate EHS has lost all perspective of reality.  Time to dial it back if we are to build up to the performance and timelines we once had.
High level leaders need to empower the organization to make decisions at the right level. Right now, there is a tendency for LT to hold onto all decisions, particularly in the Quality organization. Streamline governance processes between organizations, including cross-division, to further minimize churn. Reward individuals for thinking differently to solve problems. Free up SMEs throughout the business to share their knowledge and be more active participants on transformational initiatives. You can’t solve problems with money alone.
Have leaders acknowledge systemic inequities within the company and outline a clear plan of what actions are agreed upon to resolve.  Clarify what constitutes Fortify our Future. For many employees, it appears to be focused on the spinoff of Organon and regular restructuring events.
provide more opportunities for cross training
Continue to keep the patient at the center; be intentional about keeping people focused on the company's mission especially considering all the ongoing changes in leadership that have happened and will happen this year; ensure that folks have the resources to do their job effectively
That means selecting the employee as the first customer and concentrate efforts to satisfy their needs. First step into customer satisfaction is understand what their needs are, translate them into requirements ad these requirements into SMART goals and objectives the company can meet.
Resourcing area to sufficient numbers. The teams do not seem to have the correct resourcing levels on site  as people are completing a lot of hours outside normal working hours to keep up with workloads
Clear process owners and shorter communication lines supporting empowerment at the right level in the organisation
Evaluate and adjust the work load (distribute evenly or hire additional people) in order to successfully meet all deadlines and requirements.  Also evaluate the timing and amount of new initiatives being rolled out within the same timeframe (QSIP topics, new systems such as QualDocs, LabX, eVal, etc.).  Many new initiatives require the same people at the site to successfully deploy.
I think Merck and MSD should equip employees with resources and we must follow procedures and not deviate from them.
Have a louder voice to remove the barriers, facilitate aid, and drive towards getting this pandemic behind us.  Also be a leader to renovate the system to minimize the impact for any future pandemics or other health care related issues.
Embrace remote work. Working from home as a permanent option for non-lab based employees is key to attracting the best talent and to D&I – which Merck has a renewed focus in. Remote work allows new mothers who can't or don't want to pay the exorbitant costs for childcare to work, as well as those with physical or mental disabilities who work best in their safe space. Remote work allows people the opportunity to work from a setting where they will thrive, which is a key component to a truly diverse and inclusive work force. Having a remote option allows Merck to reach talent in other areas of the country, which not only increases the companies diversity of talent, but benefits remote regions where good jobs are needed. Working remote benefits the environment. Office buildings emit tens of thousands metric tons of CO2/year, in addition to commuting. Working remote shows you truly care about people – not just imposing an archaic hierarchical corporate power dynamic.
Listen to the Field representatives who are working in an environment like none of the Sales Leaders ever have. We are continuously being told “what” and “how” to do things right now and none of our leaders have ever worked in this environment as a representative.
Merck/MSD as a business is made up a hundred's  of silo's of people. The business as a result is very fractured and communication is poor across this siloed network. We often encounter conflicting standards or procedures when interacting with different parts of the business on the same topic. There have been in recent years a big drive to centralise many functions. It's implementation has resulted in many administrative tasks and additional systems frontline managers workers have to do. The centralised function staff don't understand our business and there are not able to solve issues when they arise. The business does not appear to value its supply chain. With the huge sums the business spends on capital expenditure and the costs involves for facility management they have a huge impact on the performance of our business. We need to look to look after our supply chain, because if you look after them they will look after you. Our business is only as good as it's worst supplier.
Just making sure that everyone understands the importance that Merck and MSD has as a company to meet the patients needs
Standardize the way users get access to our different technologies in a seamless way (i.e. trainings on how IT support models work globally)
Stay out of the politics.

I am excited to be a part of such an outstanding company and am very proud of the achievements we have made in the past. and look forward to be a part of the continued success and development of MERCK and MSD's future
We have a robust pipeline of products and Merck is always at the forefront of innovation
We have a good pipeline
Our future would be brighter if we weren’t constantly paralyzed by fear of legal issues and policies.
Oncology remains a dynamic part of business but there is looming pipeline gap. Organon spinoff exacerbated concentration risk with KEYTRUDA. Need new molecules in late stage portfolio; not enough to do more combination trials or partnerships where we get only half of the net revenue.
Great products and excited about Expedition 25 and planning for the future.
I do not believe the healthcare model we are currently operating within is truly sustainable and there will be mounting pressure for it to change.  That leaves me with a great deal of uncertainty as to how the company will choose to remain profitable and I fear a significant reduction in the workforce is likely to occur.
There is always new products and new technologies, along with changes in regulatory requirements and MSD always embraces these changes.
Excellent people and culture.  Pipeline and Reputation is good.
In the Oncology TA there is ample opportunity, however the structure of MRL, GMSA and HH needs to be addressed as the current structure is suboptimal and causes significant strife.
There seems to be a big change with the Upper management Leaders. Feels a bit like they are abandonng ship.
Big company with a great future
Although there were recently some delays and cancellations of new projects, I believe MSD is a strong company and will be able to build new exciting plans for the future
The products that we have in the market and some of the products we have in our pipeline are life changing to people and I love being able to identify and work in a company that is about changing people's lives for the better. The Merck mission incenting for life is one I support and feel proud of.
Diversity and Inclusion are slowly getting part of more discussions. It hasn't reached MRL enough yet, but the direction is better...
Merck is focused on customers and bringing new technology to the patient therefore should have a good future.
Not sure of the future with COVID and loss revenue
The future is bright, we need to keep populating our pipeline to continue our growth.  Can we continue sponsoring promising products in the pipeline and not fall victim to losing out in the next Keytruda?
I am looking forward to new projects!
This way we're focussing on the wrong issues
Appreciate the regular updates from Senior Management
I think the pipeline is very promising and will improve many patient's lifes
I am excited about the current oncology products and the pipeline.
Feel like the future of the company is somewhat irrelevant to us
I need to see more pipeline after spin off.
I am concerned that Merck may become too distracted from its core mission of developing therapies that save and improve peoples lives [at a price that is affordable].  The most socially responsible thing Merck can do is meet this goal with the bracketed language I added.

No. our resources always not here to share and have lots of rejection from marketing side. We requested to have materials support , we might only can get it one year later. Moreover, to engage with our customer, more than 2 HCPs, we need to apply for lunch and learn thru e-event platform and apply 3 days advanced with approved venue. This is something that is not feasible as there have lots of variable that out of our control. The SOP is too rigid and not flexible. This become a stressful way of working.
Product resources are getting better but definately take forever to get in hand.  Example: Q6W dosing cards
If feel that the ability for remote employees to have 1:1 training opportunities where they have questions is important. Share and Learns are good but some people learn better 1:1 seeing and doing.    My manager is very supportive but I feel HQ does not embrace change or innovation.
Policy restrictions that prohibit either mention of product or disease category make sales appointment requests a hurdle. Slow approval time frame for new data and resources to the field.
See comments above as many of the resources we utilize could be more user friendly for the HCP and sales organization.
Need additional resources to conduct business and move products, like additional funds for FFM and more studies for filed emails to meet the needs of customers. Better vPDG topics and more non branded vPDG topics.
Ergonomically speaking, it is more difficult to comfortably WFH during COVID without the right office furniture.
MSD educates the employee well before and during the work.
It has been a challenge to get appropriate approved resources for my GU role. We have been told that the agreement with AZ limits our access to promotional resources....this needs to be corrected.
Need: laptops, visual resources to share via Zoom, Webex, etc., the ability to invite customers via Zoom, Teams, etc. (whatever works for the customer), the ability to put a small amount of non-product, non-disease free text in Veeva email OR the ability to include a mention of the product in an Outlook email and attach a link to the PI so customers know what I sell, the ability to speak with MSL/HSO MAD
By limiting our ability to see customers during their free time, lunches, breakfasts through FFMs, eMFs, and Vpdgs—- when our competition is doing it - is hampering our ability to meet/see customers.
I feel that the  RAT tool has prevented me from fully engaging with some of my customers
Again, we're having to do more with less due to contractions in HQ/Organon movement.  This has put more work on our roles when we should be trying to manage sales performance.  In addition, we have not been able to backfill vacancies, which has also created holes in the department that requires representatives to call on additional customers on top of covering their respective territories.
We need more access to social media sites to be able to share Merck approved content
Rat tool is destroying my business
Material items are usually available when required. Decisions sometimes are delayed.
There are opportunities to continue to refine how our team resources are used to support our objectives.
E- Resources available for the sales force for remote audiences have been limiting especially if on a Customer platform or on Merck’s Webex. Would be helpful to have more product resources, patient resources available via all customer avenues. Including new relevant resources that would be helpful to the Customer to recover from patient declines during Covid.
Too slow to get those resources
All the assets are given are good and very help in my daily work of company
Patent will get expire soon , but no concrete strategy
THe policy 3 restrictions have severely impacted our ability to see our customers.  Also, from a virtual perspective, we do not have the resources that we need.
My team support and my experience makes my job to do well
Depends on the job scope
I have been equipped with elearning portals to help me with accessing with promo mats and understand better about data intelligence
I am in field sales.  We currently all use the same size i-pad.  It would be nice to have the larger screen i-pad.  Using the i-pad so much is putting such a strain on our eyes.  Maybe, using the larger i-pad would help to reduce some of that strain. Also, maybe they could cover up to $40 on our cell phone bills.  Market prices keep going up.

LT decisions being made in isolation and low (visible) focus on Talent Development
Work Life Balance; ongoing calls, back to back meetings
Work life balance
Dont have sufficient resource for workload, leading to overtime and lack of work life balance
I am concerned about Merck Canada Leadership.   The feeling "What's in it for me in the short term" vs. "What's in it for Merck in the long term" is the sentiment.   The strong leaders are proactively leaving the organization.   What "sounds good" is trumping what is reality.   Very concerning.  Our revenue is decreasing based on decisions that were made in the last three years (beyond COVID impact).  Very concerning.
Other: Work/life balance. It seems more and more that additional work is added when others leave the department or additional work is needed. It is troubling when it never ends. Seeing others put in 60+ hours consistently without change in sight. Short term is fine, but this has gone on much longer than expected.
If Home Office will remain as a possibility to work, after the pandemic has ended or people became vaccinated. I personally believe that Home Office is the future as how we will work and I am enjoying the flexibility Home Office provides on the work-life-balance. For me this is something essential that makes the company attractive or not as a employer.
My feedback is not on my immediate manager who is great, actively listens and tries to help. My feedback is specifically about other members of the leadership team in the organization who are actively engaged in bullying and aggression, both to their group members and to people like me who interact. The aggression is not uniform but targeted mostly to people perceived as weaker or unable to respond. I don't feel this is being taken seriously but brushed off as personality traits. This is leading to a quenching of scientific input and ideas from several talented people.
Often jobs are not given to the most qualified - but to those that have been here the longest and have the advocacy/mentors to speak on their behalf.  Unless you are 'heritage Merck'... its hard to advance in the company, particularly if you are a woman.  You resume from experience outside of Merck is not valued (ie: Yes, you've been a sales manager, but not here at Merck!, yes you've build digital systems/platforms and managed a team, but not here at Merck).. its very discouraging and leads people to depart Merck after being here only a short time.
It is too much. Too many new initiatives rolled out RAPIDLY with so many hoops to jump through that it actually takes LONGER to do a job. We have a brand new instrument for factory support, still in the box for >18 months because the DI requirements keep moving before we can get it installed.
Great to see new leaders at the executive and senior leadership levels across Merck but concerned with the risk of these leaders introducing hasty changes without appreciating the value created over the last 10+ years
Work/family balance due to arbitrary WMA timelines that are based on a 7-day work week (including working on holidays).  Because timelines have become so condensed, even more time is required to meet them beyond just the 7-day work week (eg, working most evenings).
Financial Security
it is very difficult in this political climate to feel safe about anything I feel or believe in or have opinions on.  People all over this country are being removed from their jobs in large corporations, assaulted, and other non favorable things, based on actions and narratives that benefit politicians.  I do NOT want see politics creeping into where I work.  It makes it hard to not think, that if I don't think what is perceived as the correct way, and who knows what that is anymore, I could lose my job.  As some of Merck leaders become more prominently involved in political issues, this could be signaling that Merck may follow suit with many companies that are bowing to angry masses.  I'm grateful to work at a company with a legacy of strong standards, ethics, and integrity, whether it's related to our products, or people, and hope it remains that way.
Medical benefit and employee's contribution is too high comparing to other organizations in the industry.
balancing work demands and personal life
After the pandemic, I'm concerned about working in an open space environment.  Also concerned about not knowing the plan of our new leadership.
Understanding what my priorities . Apparent inequalities in hiring.
concerned about future work and pipeline
staying connected
The site I support is in the midst of a lot of challenges with the majority being a shift in culture and mindset.  There is a lot to be done which is exciting but there is a level of stress that comes with this.
Work-life balance
Merck has traditionally been a company I am proud to work for.  However, now there is so much stress and anxiety due to constant system and process changes.  Site Ready timelines are being reduced making it hard to reach my role's responsibilities in an efficient and knowledgeable way.  At the end of the day, there are too many items that are beyond my capacity to control, making stress a high day to day constant.
None at the current time
Lack Job opportunities to advance career, lack of opportunities to grow
Stress levels that lead to physical "issues", but they get woven away.
Not supporting remote first environment.  Removing last fun from Teams - gifs.
Workload and -pressure
I am worried that the pendulum of  D&I is swinging too far to an extreme.  I sincerely hope that candidates applying for jobs are hired based on their qualifications and not solely to fill a demographic metric for Diversity.
the workload and how to feel relax even when I have tons of emails pending and work to do
Also, racial violence that is on-going.
Personal Circumstance uncertainty
Digital tools bring need out need to be supported and flexible. Eg Kneat and eVal
Let us come back to the office.  The lack of F2F meetings and interpersonal accessibility has a material impact on our quality and volume of work.
Financial security
Work life balance
The long distance from office to my home.
Im worried when I might be called back to work from office. Frankly speaking I feel working from home permanetly will be the best case for me since - I'm comfortable,, I can balance my work/personal life better, my physical and mental health is better and feel I'm more productive, working from home.
Climate Change and resulting anxiety
Product replacement and what that will look like for my position
Mental wellbeing and work-life balance.    It is so very difficult to manage workload + family balance right now.   Meeting after Meeting for many team members is difficult when children are at home as well.
Most concerned about limited opportunities for upward mobility
work and personal life balance
Merck should remain focused on science, not politics. I am most concerned about our company getting too politics and speaking for ALL employees. I don't feel like Christians are well represented as a group within Merck.
C-suite leadership seems more focused on politics than running our company well. There seems to be no tolerance for diverse thought.
I'm not convinced the necessary changes to eliminate process, bureaucracy, micro-management, and slow decision making will change with the new leadership.
Being treated fairly. Not having a certain set of rules/promotions for gender/race
I feel very disposable in the big picture of Merck.  I feel very valued on a departmental level.
career advancement
Fair compensation / salary versus other equivalent companies in the local area.
Work-Life balance
the direction of our subsidiary
Alignment across all functions towards achieving the same results
appropiate training resources to complete my training
work-life balance
as a developer I don't have the best tools and environments to work freely and with high performance
I'm concerned about health freedom. I hope people will continue to have a choice to vaccinate or not vaccinate.  I don't want to see vaccine passports being implemented, because that will take away people's freedoms and the tech companies will collect our personal data.
My other concern is to achieve a balance between work and personal life, at this moment I think is not possible.
1.  We don't have enough support personnel. 2.  My hope is with Dr. Royal's Leadership things get better.
1) Lack of opportunity for career growth 2) Manner in which important internal opportunities are given to selected few without opening it for all at site
Sibling's problems and other family problems, one related to severe covid illness.
As we move into the next phase and start returning to work, I really want to see us revisit development and how we're advancing as a team and in our own career trajectories. It feels like much of this has taken a back seat as we've navigated the pandemic. It makes sense but it's time to start looking ahead again.
I would like my company to stay out of politics
work life balance
Work overload
With everyone working from home and always online, the pace of work seems to have increased exponentially in the last year and is feeling unsustainable. Trying to engage with the many new initiatives, while also pinning down existing priorities, is at times overwhelming, with a sense that the goalposts are constantly changing. As a result, I tend to de-prioritise the valuable training/development opportunities on offer, assigning them instead to a 'nice-to-do' list. Accessing the Company's supportive 'Wellbeing' resources also feels too indulgent, compared with more pressing commitments.
