i agree that my department tried to remove barriers that slow down work however there is a lot more to go
Our Department does a good job in guiding us. they are very strategic in managing us.
There is no clear transparency when comes top to bottom . Some of informations is not reaching low level employees TBMS.  In the name of cost cutting , they cut Ex allowances . Pushes employees to do numbers sometimes come what may
For a small team we achieve a lot by being agile and open to suggestions
People see the value of removing waste but are too busy to support it.
We have a lot of systems and they are complicated to use
Budget cuts and resulting increased work loads prevent ability to promote/execute improvements/ lean ways and automation.
I think the company tries to speed thing up in general, but doesn't reduce enough existing work to help the process of speeding things up. I see lots of "project fortify" initiatives that help to reduce non-value added work, but we get headcount reductions (headcount reduction is supposed to be a benefit POST initiative implementation) before the project fortify initiatives are even close to being done, which layers on more and more work with less people and shorter timelines. We need to be able to finish our fortify projects before we can reduce FTEs.
The barriers in my work space, like being under staffed and mismanagement of personnel and trainings, makes the challenges more and more difficult to maintain an up-paced production of quality and efficiency.
We have more barriers due to policy, legal, fear of doing something incorrectly.
Our processes are evolving so quickly with the implementation of SIP and the ever changing functionality of SIP that it is hard to know what the current process is, and keeping up with the changing templates is challenging. There are also a LOT of templates located in many different places, so finding things, and finding the RIGHT things, can really be a hindrance.
Our Senior leadership in NE and CC is a very good advocate for us!  So grateful for that.
Some of the barriers have been removed, I do feel like they have be slow to revise the ‘rat’ tool.  It doesn’t balance with local knowledge and is not up to date with what state governments are allowing people to do.  Has been very tough to schedule appointments not knowing if you’re going to be red/yellow/green.
my company adds new restrictive policies on a monthly basis that make doing the job near impossible and certainly not enjoyable
Twelve RFM’s per customer/year across all sales forces? Really?
I think there is a duplication of effort between systems and a lot of overlap in populating dashboards.
I admire our commitment to compliance, but other companies seem to interpret Pharma Code differently which is likely out of anyone’s control.
During CiC, need to do double-hat working so it's very busy to catch up all things.
More and more barriers to do our job at a good rate are being put up, a lot of extra "fluff" gets added all the time while seemingly forgetting our core function.
We work with great haste and that causes some issues. We should take time to plan properly, get everybody involved onboard and then speed off, not do things and then have to stop and backtrack because it was not done properly. Managers need to listen, not dictate.
There are so many schedule changes, component issues, staffing issues, equipment issues that cause us to hit barrier after barrier. It is a never ending cycle.
Silos have grown back over the past several years. Limited if any collaboration between different species segments  As a company we have hired people based upon a demographic model and not the best or most qualified applicants
I think we try very hard to do this and sometime we are unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, such as GMP regs.  However, the culture of the Pilot Plant is to be innovative and be at the forefront of development and this makes innovation a part of the fabric of the culture.  The end result is the removing of waste and barriers with an increase in efficiency.
I feel we are making progress in this space to simplify and continued commitment to the realization of our digitially enabled, MPS enabled supply chain coupled with culture of empowerment will remove barriers we encounter quickly
The RAT tool is a huge hindrance to my business!   Other representatives from other companies have been out calling on customers, at their discretion, pretty much the whole time.  Also, having it week to week is a horrible idea. I cant plan anything!   Most of my customers just want me to come to their office and do my job, they don’t want (and don’t have time) to do it for me to do it virtually.   I can’t do my job as well as I would like to.
Scientists need to do significantly more than their classical job description.Working on the "barriers" would be a fun and rewarding component of work if we rallied around them together and celebrated the wins.
Technicians are adding more and more meetings, projects, and testing that is starting to effect moral and overall attitudes with each other and about Merck.
My main job responsibility is to be in the field with my representatives, and numerous barriers are in place that basically completely prevent that from happening. I have an OSR that needs some good coaching. She had 3 live customer interactions just last week, yet I can’t go because I’m not permitted to fly and my district is very large. The RAT also prevented that yet I’m fully vaccinated.
our workload is increasing
change control process delays a lot of changes (although i understand change management is necessary).  they do well with what they can control though.
Medical approval remains a bottle neck for our franchise
Policy 3 barriers are more conservative than other companies.
Barriers are identified and actions taken to overcome these.
Over the last 12 months I've seen more and more barriers, processes, groups, reporting layers etc. be erected. Work is actually harder to know than it was when they first started talking about wanting to make it easier and fast to our work. Because the leaders don't really understand and see it first hand or talk to the people that are doing the work they don't understand that. They only see a story that is created and filtered by the various reporting layers. Our senior leaders don't understand what  it really takes to do the work.
On an Agile based project where this is a focus.  Transparency in work progress and impediments is key.
Senior VPs too static , and hesitating to evolve their model , which had been very successful but we also need to adapt to évolutions of tech, digital, ways of life and new generations of clients needs ; we probably can not wait for their retirement to evolve roles, structures and style
Many of the systems, processes and decision making is slow and time consuming. Understanding of the real world context is missing. Customer centricity is lacking
Our Quality organization fights tooth and nail against change and doesn't push the status quo.
While I completely appreciate the concern for Covid, the weekly RAT tool is, not only a physical barrier that slows down our work.  After almost 14 months of Covid restrictions, it is becoming a mental and emotional barrier, as well.
for some parts agree, for others disagree, so answer in the middle
In general yes, however there tends to be analysis paralysis when engaging other global groups that may not align.
There are many silos and that if everyone knew what would be coming next with communication, there would not be so may things at once that can slow down teams, instead of losing focus on main goals/strategies.
In the past year, there have been more barriers independent of what has been going on with COVID-19.  RAT tool from red-green-yellow and the back and forth.  This has required many cancelling of important customer engagements.  The restrictions placed on future programming is very concerning.  The limitations on how many times we may have an FFM with an HCP is not a wise decision.  We are being asked to meet the same goals with new restrictions that are definite barriers to how we conduct our business.
In our team there is open communication.
not really.
There are some workstreams that seem like they're intended to demonstrate to the organization that we're "data-driven" or "focused on digital" or "agile" (aligned to the declared priorities), but without clear business objectives or impact. This takes away from our ability to deliver and drive value because we are expected to be part of workstreams that "show" Senior Leaders that we're checking the right boxes. The purpose of some workstreams seems to be more about a leader having a success story to showcase to Senior Leaders than to make a real business impact. When we ask questions about the objective or challenge the purpose of some projects, it's ignored or not well received. It's especially challenging given how stretched some teams are this past year with the pandemic.
no always, depends on the nature of the barrier and who it is affecting (rank and status of the person)
Some inefficiencies around disconnect to Audit / Procurement / Site Quality Expectations are there but should be resolved as we work through to the Expedition 25
systems are always changing, processes are too cumbersome and complex
It is not easy to do since there are strong silos in Merck, especially between MMD and MRL when it comes to managing E2E change control.  We need more of a one Merck mindset.  Leadership at all levels need to reinforce the importance.
Excess of bureaucracy delay part of the work
Very slow in decision making .
staffing and training needs improvments
In some instances we try to remove barriers but in others, they persist for years on end with no improvement. Managers also play favorites which is detrimental to the functioning of the team.
Continue to have programs for employee development in other areas of the business.
Flexibility for remote working. Since COVID, the company needs to realise there is no need for an office environment.
1. It is not enough to comply with minimum country laws. As a global company our standards should be as high as the most liberal country laws when it comes to diversity employment. Examples; recognition and facilitation of same sex and defacto couples when opportunities arise in countries where these relationships are not legally recognized.  2. Not excluding HIV related illnesses on company health insurances.  3. More clarity on end of year review processes and the outcomes and feedback provided so we can take action and grow in response to the review outcomes 4. recognition of talent in regional areas; focus on promotion and development for smaller countries. Better understanding that roles in smaller countries are often more diverse and multifaceted than the same names role in a larger country and recognition of same.
Reduce and rationalise mandatory training to that which is directly relevant to your role. Currently it is poorly targeted and compounded by the excessive SOP revisions that themselves create unnecessary training burden. The frequency of re-training for the same SOP has now got to the point where it is counterproductive as no one remembers which subtle change was introduced when, and whether they are still current.
Give children of long term employees the opportunity to break into MSD.
Provide senior leadership opportunities in regions as compared to concentrated senior leadership roles in US.
To respect the senniorities of employees.
be creative and steady step moving forward on bio-pharmaceutical area.
There are very subtle types of bullying in the company amongst certain colleagues. It is carried out in a way that is not easy to identify to pin point. Company should continue to emphasize a no-tolerance for any form of bullying.
Could it be some welfare in traditional holidays? Such as Spring festival. Thanks.
Provide more opportunities for locals to assume leadership positions, allow locals to be part of the succession plan and realized these plans. Whenever there is a director and above role open, it was never a local that assumed the position. The role was always given to foreigners, imported foreigners who had never been to the country and have never worked at the site before.
I feel satisfied of how the company takes care of its employees now
Reduce complexity. pause the torrent of global initiatives.
Merck and MSD was already prioritize the needs of the employees
Just continue to innovate and create nore medicines and vaccines for the inprovement of healthcare system of this world.
leaders to lead by example, embrace desired culture/ values and provide timely feedback to jerky behaviors/ actions to promote D&I and work efficiency
no comments currently
New launch of products
Open for discussion and everyone welcome to ask freely. More trust.
If recognised to a achiever’ s family also. They can also think that his/ her spouse work a great place
Should work on the CTC, Expenses (Surely) and incentives.
Merck and MSD is one of largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Being a big MNC right now Merck and MSD should focus on 3 Ps to me right now, and they are Process, People and Performance. It is linked to each other, if the PROCESS for the entire company goes well, PEOPLE will be retained and job satisfaction will come, so it will be reflected by Merck and MSD’s overall PERFORMANCE at the end. So together as an organisation it will RISE
Continue to enhance Way-of-Working, especially regarding collaboration across Divisions / Functions / Sub-Functions; encourage learning and experimentation; and encourage inclusion of different perspectives / culture / background.
As it is, MSD is a great place to work.
Company should give clear idea about what will be the action plan after LOE, and is there any new product is there in pipeline or
Bringing new products and building up the strong engagement plan with HCP’s
Make employees feel appreciated.
Personel should not preceived as a cost, but as a valuable asset and investment
Allow flexible work options (stay at home work shifts specifically) that are currently in place as part of COVID controls to be permanent
balance between work and life
A lot of focus on the development plans etc is a great step in the right direction, but the company should also focus on creating the opportunities to execute on the plans and have a more integrated / transparent approach to managing talent.
Just keep going in the same direction. MSD is the best place I've worked at!
Work with each other! Work with people! Don't hide behind words or procedures. Make it more efficient! We have one goal!
Our company apparently gives support and value to its people and we feel it very much especially during this pandemic period. We hope this value increasingly go on.
fair day of work naleven
More commitment on people management, people development. More commitment to internal regulations.
Be the most innovative and progressive. We are a company dedicated to health, so we should think more of a mental state of the employees (and not only), too. Giving more days off, or shorter work week could be a start. This pandemia showed us everything is possible - even work from home. There are competitors in pharma field who already started to provide their employees the benefit mentioned previously. Do not let the competitors to lure the talent from Merck and MSD.
nothing
1) Work on equal chances for people from different teams. Some teams are in a great position - their members get promoted on a regular basis. On the other hand, people in teams of more unfortunate position, who are working hard as well, are hitting the wall. This is regarding their promotions, pay rise, trainings, rotation,.. But also in case they need external sources and the team does not have budget for it.  2) People who are longer in Merck/MSD are forced to leave and rejoin the company to keep up their salary with the market. It is very frustrating to see people in the company for more than 5 years, doing an amazing job. But all they hear is that their manager cannot do anything more for them.
Remove duplicate organizations, and initiatives that add little to no value but cause confusion and added work  to the base and clients, while trying to justify themselves.  Reinforce the base (Site facing roles, country ops) that have a direct impact on productivity, quality, patient safety and the image of our company . Shift to a patient centric approach make efficient bio-sample manegement a priority for cancer pts. We are an old complex company compared to other biopharmas. It is time to streamline our company from the top down.
More resources in Regulatory Affairs so that people have enough time to think upfront and use innovative strategy, that we cannot do when overloaded.
Reduce the amount of meetings or clearly indicate on invite, if a meeting is mandatory or if it will be recorded / both global and local meetings
optimize work processes with 100% input from the users, not only global input
Stop enacting weird policies before you sample the general feeling what might happen, especially outside of US. We are a global company. Things like censoring MS Teams GIFs or trying to stop people from using best browser Chrome - just makes people angry at first and then apathetic. Don't expect such people to innovate or drive change.
The Company should take into consideration changing the succession plans at all levels and allow for people to change positions more easily. Today, with the linear structure, people are very often stuck at one position, without vision of the next step, making that we lose great colleagues as we speak.....
For me, it already is this kind of working place.
Incentivise performance. It is not working with today's bonus structure   Challenge the ways we are doing things and that the leadership team has the courage to make change  Scale down the processes that kills productivity and creativity. We spend too much time project managing projects instead of delivering results.
Introduce a 'respect people's time' policy. Too many meetings are called where it's not clear what the purpose is, why I was invited, my role etc. Meetings that could be accomplished by an email. Respect people's time: provide an agenda, make it clear what people's role in the meeting will be etc etc
continue to give energy back in these challenging times
Some groups in MSD have the thinking that since they've worked "long enough" in MSD decisions should lie with them withou input from newer, more younger members of the team. This goes away from the principle of "Diversity and Inclusion". This has led to younger members leaving the organisation venturing to places where they feel they will be heard. Also some think seniority allows them to pass snide remarks at newer employees about their position and status. THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE
Making decisions at the right level, employees should feel more empowered. This is still such a consensus driven company where the risk always needs to be minimal in whatever we do.
Encourage people to speak their mind & a culture of openness and transparency. Needs more resource as people are too stretched and working overtime.
Clean up the dirty apples....
Find new ways to increase accountability.
ensure there are sufficient staff to do the work to high quality.  Align human health and MRL/GCTO - there is poor communication between these two groups at the moment.
Focus more on getting ALL employees feel appreciated and important, to allow for engagement, creativity and innovation.
Reduce meetings, allow people time to do their work inside the working day. Respect peoples vacation time. People feel under pressure to log on early am, evenings and weekends to manage their workloads.
keep up the good work, communicate any changes timely
Continue advocating inclusion and diveristy in all departments and functions, to ensure people have a voice and sense of belonging.  Provide sturctured coaching & development frameworks for those who are actively seeking improvement, growth and willingness to take on addtional responsibilities.
Develop and publish a company work from home policy post Covid-19. Properly resource areas that are under resourced. Ensure global teams are aligned with site teams when they interact or perform activities with sites. Ensure site prioritizes the workload and has a plan in place to deliver that work load over the course of the year
It's hard to have work life balance. There are many exciting new projects and improvements happening but it's a challenge to find the time to fully support/implement the products within the working day.
More emphasis on continuity of relationships with (key) customers
Streamline bureaucracy and documentation requirements Share and promote advanced technical solutions or tools that are already in place at MSD (and share the use case) but people often don't know about them (PowerAutomate, PowerApps, Confluence, to name a few but there's certainly many more)
Empower people from every level of the organization and to allow more experimentation bottom-up and not top-down.
Invest more in the people, align workload and available resources.
Enforce Meeting Free Feedback Friday thoughout Nordic/Baltic, which allow concentrated time to 1 - Reflect and think strategy in quite suroundings, complete work, reflect and give feedback, reflect and plan for next week & allow better work/life balance if this allow sence of control before weekend.   Enforce 3 min quite note-taking in workshops  - - to allow writing down your own thoughts before the meeting organizer say too much   Enforce meeting invites should NOT start at x.45.   We initiated 45 min meetings to allow a smsll reflection brake before the next meeting.  COnsequence now is that people log shorter meeting,non stop - and you squeeze 3-4 meetings into 2 hours.   Transition cost between issues is high and people is worn out
Be more flexible, less bureaucratic, more open to the customers' needs
Merck and MSD can drive further on business development opportunities and manage growth in future years.
Continue to promote flexible working and encouraging diversity and inclusion
Keep the employees informed of what's going on the workplace Individual & Teams recognition Assessment of wage scales to keep us competitive on the markets
Find a way to ease the stress, people are working too hard. young parents with kids at home - communicate a global policy to help them, there are plans in certain markets, it should be global. Something that will make them feel the company see them as human beings. How can we expect them to work as if their kids are not at home I don't have young kids, I see their pain)
I understand the goals and priorities within IT, but I feel that due to the many intricate dependencies, timelines are very aggressive and require 'cyber-response' levels of effort, at the expense of work/life balance. Seems that because we were able to band together for that common cause, that level of commitment is expected for every transformative initiative since.
Transparency, Listen to opinions  of all, Treat everyone equally, Don't promote personal gains in scheduling,
Add more resources for support staff for technical areas.
Our VP makes Merck a great place to work and deliver our mission !
If working from home longer afford me a way to purchase a chair which is needed for my scoliosis, health.  I have purchased everything on my own. My team is able to purchase everything they need. Me being an admin cannot even buy a chair. Or if anything all  the excess chairs at the office could be utilized.
Need to promote a better understanding of the overall business, and what is the future.  There is a perception that Merck is behind other companies on agility and technology.
Even when managers are open to discussions there's a culture on hired people not to speak up. There's a gap in there. Mostly that may be caused by the homogeneity on hired people. Most employees were educated from childhood to move things in the background instead of open manage issues.
Embrace hybrid workforce. Some aspects of our jobs are fully able to be done remotely, some need to be in person to foster creativity/collaboration/efficiency. Give the workforce more of an opportunity to own their time.
Hire/promote people who really care about patients/business need rather than blindly follow directions.
Flexibility between working from home & working in the office in instances where a role can be performed remotely
match salaries to other pharma companies
Be "inclusive" of all... not just politically expedient groups of current media attention.  The current political commentary by the CEO alienates many employees... resulting in fear to speak up about beliefs or any discussion of differing opinions.  This is not just a feature of Merck, but it is definitely a suppression of voices and tends to contribute to concerns about how well the company supports its employees regardless of ethnicity or beliefs.  The CEO should be a Chief Cheerleader for the company's products and employees, not a cultural voice.  Customers are commenting on this behavior in a negative manner.
1.)Support Coaches when they ask for information or items (I'm getting ignored frequently). 2.) Have ONE repository for documentation at Wilson. Right now, I have 4 places where docs are stored and struggle to find what I need. SFRS is not user-friendly. 3.) Encourage team-building events, especially when exhibiting a high degree of flexibility right now.
Continue to empower decision making at the right level. Improve diversity representation (especially for our customer facing organizations) across all levels. Merck should consider offering Sabbatical to encourage employees to learn new things, decompress, prioritize family over work for some time.
You are doing a great job!
It would be nice if the global organization would take a position on working remotely.  The US organization has taken the position that employees can work remotely if they choose that is the right decision for them. It would help if the global organization would let employees know if they will be required to return to the office or if they can choose to remain remote.
Stop making things more complicated than they need to be.
when the time is right (Covid 19 Retrictions are lifted) offer in person team building or networking opportunities so that colleagues can once again engage together in person.
Continue to empower employees, prioritizing the most important work that delivers business value (to take some non-value add work off our plates)
We are becoming more and more restricted from a compliance standpoint which often makes this job difficult and  holds us back from providing the support needed by our HCP’s and patients.
I am just 3 weeks working for MSD, so I can't have good answer on this question
Provide specified  number of sick days...reluctant to take sick day if I feel it might be viewed as “too many” sick days...some idea of expectation would be nice.
More comfort in job security. If there will be a restructure, invest more time in helping individuals find new roles or placing them in new roles. We seem to let a lot of good people go and then rehire them back in different roles.
Continue with at least the same level of support and candid information sharing that we have now. There is some uneasiness around Ken and Mike Nally leaving. It's important that the culture we have built here not change too much, because it's such a great place to work.
From the sales point of view, it feels like we are being to asked to more with less, which is fine to a point. However there are some key things we need, beyond Veeva, that we are not getting. Maybe ask sales reps what is more important X or Y and let us chose what is eliminated. There are many items in ROME I’d be happy to give up for a paper detail aid to leave behind or coupons to hand to my customers. Digital offers are great, but there are some ‘tweaks’ that need to be made that we’ve asked for many times that go unfulfilled.
Consider policies specific to individual groups/work teams, and apply to each as appropriate. Not all teams operate in the same way e.g. structure, customer needs, market dynamics, speed of change.
Continue to be open to trying to WoW even if that means failing and starting over. We need to try things, learn from our mistakes and move on to the next thing.
make sure that employees feel safe about their jobs
Try to keep politics out of the workplace.
As per pervious comments around customer facing resources and their functionality.  It was also disappointing to be eligible for a sales incentive trip as a result of hard work and commitment during the most trying of times and not have the  recognition both personally or financially.
Keep on listening to the needings of the employees, as you are doing now, and address these needings.
Continue to ask for actual feedback
I would like to see more involvement from external areas making decisions and how those decisions impact my area, more inclusion and collaboration rather than the "process now and deal with consequences" approach.
support employees working on covid projects better and recognize the number of hours and dedication required to work on a project at this timeline
Management is out of touch and is not aware of the toxic and negative work environment they are creating.  Perhaps that should be an area of more concern.
Continue to allow for the flexibility (remote working, alternate schedules, etc.) post-pandemic even when we are able to return to the office
Fully embrace and balance with personal accountability for performance, the concept of individual's control over flexible work (location and calendar control).
With working from home, the new ways of working = more & more meetings.  No one calls each other anymore and everything is structured into meetings at all hours of the day.  We need more work/life boundaries and flexibility.
I feel that people are burnt out and don't feel like they can take vacation time off to discharge and still need to be connected during time off just to manage through workloads.  This isn't a pandemic related issue this has been going on for a long time at Merck.
Be more strategic and proactive about hiring resources to support increasing workloads, instead of doing it when things are dire and not taking into consideration that additional resources and time are needed to train new employees up to speed where they can positively contribute.  Reduce administrative burdens on scientists so they can focus on core deliverables.  Provide managers more guidance in how to have effective development conversations.
MSD seems to have missed the mark with recent acquisitions, particularly with COVID items.  The company also seems to have missed the mark with external communications involving strategy and changes to the business.  Very little is known about the Organon spin-off (perhaps by design), our direction "post-Covid" and "post-spinoff" seems exceptionally cloudy.  I think the new MSD, post organon, should take a serious look at marketing our brand as we look to become more of a nimble growth oriented company.  We'll attract better talent, which in turn will help enable our future.
Continue to allow for and encourage remote work where applicable.
Continue to embrace Diversity & Inclusion
MSD is really making an excellent job to continue being a great place to work. I have been in this company for just a few months and I am totally surprised with the amount of areas involved in employee training, improvement and satisfaction. MSD employee oriented vision is touching every single employee and manager.
1) Managers providing support for their people  and projects versus absorbed in promotion of company initiatives would be of great value. 2) Employees able to do their job well and being well-trained versus having to participate in various company workstreams and initiatives in order to get successful ratings.  Add to that these folks are usually hand picked for these opportunities versus the most qualified person for the job.  There is not equal opportunity for all.  1 example CRA only at Merck for 1 year who is now on a developmental plan to become a therapeutic area lead. What? I've not been given this opportunity.  3) Sites and employees are extremely frustrated with Merck company systems that don't work or are difficult, cumbersome, and techno challenging - SIP.  Implore Merck management if you want to be partner of choice, please stop rolling out systems that don't work and/or employees are expected to run, troubleshoot, and brainstorm everyday to do the job.
Stop placing so much emphasis on education and degrees and allow employees who are experienced and capable to move up within the company.
good pay Employee retention  Invest in training/education
reasonable expectations that are consistent with the actual work functions would be nice.
Continue to openly communicate how company looks out for the interests of employees. Continue to communicate plans for return to site (for remote workers) even if the plans are still in development. Knowing that there is discussion and thought going on is just as important as the end result.
1. Continue simplification efforts across the enterprise. 2. Continue to engage people in acting on Fortify principles in concrete ways. 3. Encourage fewer large-scale, report-out style meetings and encourage more informal, goal-oriented working sessions to innovate and resolve issues. The report-outs are less productive. 4. Improve WorkDay with accurate titles and easy-to-find organizational reporting structures; right now you have to go down each reporting "trail" and piece the org structure together separately.
People ownership and clear role & responsibility
Continue to think differently around wAys of Working.  Without the pandemic, so much of our positive change would not have happened.  So how do we continue to think differently, work differently and break down barriers after the pandemic versus getting stuck in habits and going back to old ways of working.  Good progress on opening up “HQ Roles” and allowing remote workers to compete.  Agile work and teams, etc.
Consider a 4 days working week with the option to provide employees the chance to distribute their working hours over 4 working days.
Continued remote flexibility post-COVID 19.  Continue family/childcare support benefits. Consider work/life impact of unplanned high priority projects.
Simplify processes.
Listen more to other's perspectives on project tasks, try to incorporate more of the input rather than take a one vision approach.
Improvements to work/life balance.  Too many employees are forced to work evenings/weekends to keep up with production needs.
Have managers who walk the talk. I believe that there is a lot of noise about D&I and work/life balance, but I do not believe all managers epitomize it or fully support their employees here. Examples include: sympathizing that we work too much and encouraging us to prioritize and say no, but then having days that start with a meeting at 7 am and end with a meeting that goes until 5:30 pm (implying that that's how long the workday should be); saying that they understand the difficulties that working from home has created but making it extremely difficult/uncomfortable to request basic office supplies via the company-wide employee purchase program.   It's troubling and disappointing that these are all topics that have been repeatedly and heavily discussed, but no real changes have been implemented that have had a broad and true impact throughout the organization.
Beneficts
Be open to innovative ideas as long as they align with the business of Merck. Merck talks innovation, however it seems things are still done as usual and innovative (evidenced-based) ideas are not embraced.
I think Merck should continue to support our work/life balance...please do not change. This has been the best balance of my career. I think Merck should recognize the pain that black employees -SPECIFICALLY AMERICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES.... may be suffering right now in this social and political climate. Too often black problems are grouped into other "DIVERSE" groups at work. I want to see more black women in leadership. We are more than qualified.
1. Improve Corporate IT.  Less outsourcing.  HCL is very difficult to work with. 2. If Merck continues to add more Quality requirements, then they need to provide additional Merck employees (not contractors) to meet these new requirements.  "Do more with less" does not work as there is a not a lot of leeway and innovation allowed when dealing with Quality.
For me, competitive compensation is an important part of feeling valued at work.  I was really disappointed about our low company scorecard (and therefore low bonuses) last year, and it's unclear to me what I or my organization can do to change our scorecard.  It's fairly demotivating to not have clearly tangible things I or my department can do to prevent a low scorecard next year, and I worry we might see the same outcome as last year, even though we will have done everything we can think of to prevent it.
More communication from leadership.  Speed of innovation and product launch given the lessons learned from our competitors in the COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic effort.  We need to be faster.  Break down silos.
OUR PAY SCALE IS AMONG THE LOWER END OF THE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE LOST SOME GREAT TALENT FOR 10-20% MORE PAY AND WE HAVE 2 NEW HIRES ON MY TEAM WHO IM SURE ARE LOW ON THE PAY SCALE BUT ARE WORTHLESS IN THEIR SALES ABILITY. I REALIZE MERCK WILL PAY A LITTLE MORE FOR ONCOLOGY AND SOME OTHER DIVISIONS BUT INEFFECTIVE, CHEAPER EMPLOYEES DO NOT HELP DRIVE BUSINESS. MERCK USE TO BE VALUED AMONG OUR INDUSTRY AS A TOP PLACE TO WORK, BUT NOW WE HAVE THE REPUTATION AS LOWEST PAYING AND THAT DRIVES TALENT AWAY.
Properly resource so employees are not super overworked and overwhelmed with the amount of additional work that is being heaped onto them.  Working around the clock and on weekends continuously is not a healthy way to live.  The stress takes a toll on your health.
Balance among work and life out of work.
There is considerable talk about "talent" development; however, as very transparently noted a few years ago, "talent" development is restricted to a few pre-selected individuals; thereby under utilization of the potential of the majority of the company.  Similarly, for a company that talks about D&I, again I remember clearly starting from 2-3 years ago, managers stating that they are looking for a young workforce.
Be clear on the long-term growth strategy and make the necessary decisions to make it happen, including resource realignment and talent incentive schemes
ensure there are opportunities for all employees to advance their careers based on actual merit and performance in interviews. Current promotions - and even laterals - are determined by 1-whether or not and how much your boss supports you, 2-whether you are in a management development program, 3-whether you have a sponsor, 4-where you are on the talent grid (which goes back to #1).  Ironically if your boss doesn't support you, you can either remain in your job forever, or choose to leave the company in order to escape your predicament.
Better compensation (specifically base pay and annual bonus) to attract better talent. Our compensation is below our peers and therefore we are not getting the best candidates to fill out open spots.
Ensure that the best talent is getting promoted and getting opportunities to grow so they know they have a future at the company or else people will get recruited from competitors. COVID has changed the ways companies are operating and Merck should learn from the flexible working arrangements that many other companies are shifting to. Personally commuting is very stressful and the option to work from home more often has made me much more productive.
Re-focus work on enhancing and extending the lives of patients rather than political activism and political correctness.
Continue to deliver on mission of George Merck to deliver medicine for the people.  Also, to continue to deliver innovative treatments for patients with cancer.    For Merck and MSD employees, maintain talent by a creative schedule (flexibly work days and another week off), less meetings.    Increase promotions or change the levels to be competitive  The work day has increased and promotions have decreased.      Keep talent here at Merck and MSD to help deliver on our mission!
I am proud to work for Merck.  I have seen the company be very supportive of its employees through my career but especially during the pandemic.
Ensure that everyone, regardless of who they are, where they come from, or what they believe are safe to be their authentic self at work.  I know the company is trying to ensure this, however, some voices are louder and more accepted then others.   Also, profit sharing with the employees, such as RSUs, is a real incentive and proves that Merck truly invests in their employees.
None to suggest at this time - I feel they are doing a great job!
Be less bureaucratic and make decisions faster.  Too often, too many layers of the organization slow us down. Also, I fear we are trying to do too many things "pretty well" rather than focusing on fewer things (i.e disease areas, modalities, platforms) and doing them exceptionally well.
Drive sustainability, diversity and inclusion
Listen to the shop floor, not just the support groups.  Stop looking at us like the enemy.
More management exposure to the organization. More townhalls to set the positive tone
Demonstrate support for employees: pandemic response was poor relative to other pharma companies (no on-site testing despite mandatory on-site presence, no effort to assist with or provide access to vaccines). Ensure compensation and perks are on par with competing organizations to help promote talent retention.
Provide the needed resources and tools to allow everyone to do their best.
I don't believe Merck truly values its employees. It could be far worse, but it could be much better.
Continue discussions about diversity and inclusion.   Give transparency to how situations are handled when people have a boss who is a jerk. Also, give managers an easier path to dismiss poor performing or jerky employees.  I have seen jerky employees be transferred through various organizations in lateral moves because they can not be dismissed (even though the manager has a compelling documented case.)
Provide people with more opportunities for exposure and to grow and learn. Many managers do not mentor and live by "I" not "we". That said, they ask teams to do great work but then do not give them the opportunity to present it themselves.  Additionally, when people challenge the status quo, we are still told "well that is how we do it here". It can be frustrating and demotivating when we are tasked to evolve the organization but at times are hindered from being permitted to do so.
Continue to pursue new and novel treatment options for the unmet needs in medicine.  Embrace technology and new ways of working.  It seems to me that Pfizer and Moderna embraced new technology in the pursuit of effective vaccine options for Covid.  Why did we not embrace this technology?  As we pursue the noble and important goals for diversity and inclusion, it will be necessary to truly be open to all thinking and opinions.  Being open does not mean you have to agree nor does it mean that you can’t think a certain way.  As Merck steps into the political conversations, our company runs the risk of disadvantaging/discriminating against candidates/employees based on political alignment and beliefs.  And I don’t think this would be a desirable outcome.
Honestly take a look at employees salaries and give them adjustments to meet the industry standards. It would be great if I would get paid what I am worth.
Leave politics out of the work place and stay focused on the work at hand.
-Practice true prioritization -Re-distribute workload -Create an environment in which it is possible for employees to take time off (working 16 hours one day so that one can take off the next does not constitute as, "vacation time". -Leadership telling employees, "Take time off" while not taking any actions that allow for reasonable workload and deadlines is meaningless
Continued focus on Science and operational excellence.
Ensure compensation is competitive and benefits are competitive.
Focus on the company, patients, pipeline, and employees rather than using the company name & platform to push the personal political views of a few people at the top management level.  The constant push for Diversity and Inclusion is creating a new and large group of people within the company that are no longer "included" and are not allowed to be heard (white/Christian).
Focus on innovation and employee development.
We need better employee empowerment at all levels. This is were people feel their input matters and they have input into decisions. Inclusive behaviors need to be modeled at multiple layers of the organization. I want to make sure my voice is heard and I do not have to cover or pretend so that I can bring my authentic self to work.
1)  Ensure that the work we are doing is RELEVANT to the mission, and not just pushing puzzle pieces to the next open space. 2)  Too much use of cc: field of e-mail in hopes that the other person will do the work, independent that the other person or team isn't the right one anyway. 3)  We used to have a rule that said "3 ping-pong's on an e-mail was the max. permissible" and then a phone call or other "in person" communications was mandatory to resolve the topic.   Sadly, we see 20+ pings and pongs and nothing gets done by the right person.  Too many distribution lists are used, or non-person mail accounts that represent black holes or dead-mailboxes. 4)   Bring back ITOM v.2 - "Get me involved, get me involved early."   What happened to this?   Bringing "me" in at the last moment can't be tolerated any more.
- Revamp communication practices, transparency & silo-ing. We've made a lot of progress but there's an enormous way to go. - Develop stronger talent retention plans, beyond conventional in-line promotions
Please continue to prioritize the "affordability" of our products.  We need to be challenged to deliver on these 3 things: Quality/Compliance, Low Cost, and Short Lead-time.  All 3 at the same time, not just 1 or 2.
Put tools in place to improve efficiency as a means to increase production and profits.
Provide a way for customers to receive discounts on our products for high volume purchases.
To incentive the balance between the personal life and work.
Continuing to make employees feel empowered and trusted.    One recent example where this may not have taken place is the removal of GIFs from communicating.     GIFs were a great way to build togetherness in this remote work environment so to remove them based on a fear of how they may be used did not seem to reflect trust in employees.
We are too slow! Last to market on about everything. We need to be more nimble with our R&D activities. The list of needs haven't changed.
Continue to offer training and support webcasts for working mothers.  Culture in Merck Vaccines is like no other.  I feel supported having the option to work remotely or in person.  I’ve been able to work for effectively having this option to provide customers.
1.  Allow for new job field sales titles and  expand S3 for vaccines.  This change would demonstrate tenure and long term customer relationship capital is valued.   2.  Re-evaluate fair market compensation by job roles.  Each field sales role is unique.  (Ex. Hospital, Chronic, Oncology, HIV, Vaccines, etc.).  Skills for each job role may assist with providing adequate benchmarks for compensation.  (Ex. contracting, buy/bill, HIT, quality, stakeholders, variety of customer types, etc.) 3.  PPO payout at territory level for vaccines.  Individual PPO for vaccines allows for the more indivisible accountability.  Other peer vaccine company's do evaluate their team on an individual productivity.  Other Merck sales teams use individual PPO to evaluate their teams.  Including territory managers with PPO responsibility similar to CTLs and DCOs allows for more equity in the  SIP program.
Continue to adapt to the rapidly changing workforce.
Truly make it “safe to speak up” without fear of judgment or consequences.  Even if we speak up sometimes we are not validated or nothing gets done to change.  Just going through the motions. Sometimes difficult if management assumes everything is ok.
Keep working on the diversity and inclusion within all members of the company, try to teach their managers to fully understand different perspectives
For IT needs, there has to be a better way to share needed information. In addition there is too much similar work going on in different areas. There is not enough oversight as to the work being done and leveraging tools that already exist. Or to connect those with similar needs to make a tool that works for both.
I‘d suggest we further simplify way of working, avoid some unnecessary routines/checks and focus on the key ones.
Take time to hear different perspectives about a problem.
Focus on work life balance
Publically commit to these improvements: - Break down the silos and increase cross-TA communications and processes - Implement a promotion ladder for everybody - an explicit statement of what each person needs to do in order to get promoted. This requires liberalizing the credential requirements in job descriptions so there is room to move up.  - Hold HR and the manager accountable when a high-rated colleague leaves the company. - Change our compliance-driven policies to align with industry standards. Most are more restrictive; some are less restrictive than industry standards. This attests to a body of compliance rules that is not accountable beyond the internal organization. - Recognize that our SOP's are not built for learning. Each should be accompanied by and introduced with a training slide deck.
Please authorize oncology reps to mail compliant resources to customers immediately.  Customer request for resources would increase if it were a positive experience. Currently to order an approved customer leave behind or patient education resource thru ROME and have it mailed to a customer ((where its received 3 weeks later and the wrong item)) does a disservice to the oncology customer, the patient waiting for the info and the rep who has spent years building and maintaining trust with the office.   Merck should immediately update the guidance around field reps mailing Rome items to their customer when personal delivery is impossible. Thank you
Fill the pipeline Employ people who are really into the job not only for their own career.
be transparent about how we failed developing a Covid vaccines / lessons learn for the future
Simply systems and procedures.  Use user friendly systems, some of the systems we use are not user friendly or fit for purpose
having the right motivators/mentors/managers/team leaders is important since this influences directly all the people & work environment below them
Simplify the ways of working in all business layers so you create  more uncluttered /streamlined cross functional /business processes. A lot of newly introduced processes which seemingly have a lot of interfaces are all induvidually introduced which blocks the bird eye view
It would be great if the messages delivered by upper management (CEO, CPO, head of MRL, etc...) trickled down to individual line managers in day to day interactions. I know upper management says we need to take care of ourselves and our families and that our health matters but in practice, the work demands are still very high, tasks still need to be completed at top speed, the expectations to perform at top level are still there and there is a lack of compassion for those who still have to manage child care and work full time (especially when your manager's personal situation differs from your own).
Half day on Fridays- all colleagues well deserve this!
Endeavour to remove the barriers that slow us down. We need to be a speed boat not an oil tanker. Sometimes I feel we are way to cautious. Simplify the language within the SOPs sometimes SOPS contain contradictions. Could I take this opportunity to thank the UK LT they have been incredible throughout this pandemic. I have never felt so connected and a part of this incredible company.
1-Gain more Employees loyalty & trust
organize more staff activities
Ensure that IT systems are aligned and transfer information from one department to another, breaking down silos here as well. To little oversight and direction, little leadership in IT, on which we all depend. The company is held together by excel sheets, manually.
Diversify the portfolio by integrating advanced technology and research like focusing on cell and gene therapy and drug devise technology, leveraging and capitalizing ICH concepts in quality so serve patient needs more quickly and efficiently.
Reduce bureaucracy and simplify processes
Remove as many silos as possible, particularly in the business. Focus on process excellence across the enterprise - how can end users do their jobs more efficiently, more holistically. Enable technology to better enable workers to do their jobs - tech should not be viewed as a barrier for business/end users. Skill up business users to be more technology savvy - not only in basics, but beyond.  They should not be afraid of technology at work but rather embrace it.
Invest in technology more
It would be nice if Merck truly embraced inclusion, including diversity of thought, by acknowledging all sides and all thoughts and ideas.
Please make it so people have reasonable, stable work.  Continuous improvement shouldn't devolve into chaos and, while we should all embrace change, it should not diminish the the fidelity of our work.
Cut out all the frilly crap and be honest with ourselves. We are all here to do a job , not to be best buddies ! We have the people and should ensure we get the best out of them. I respect people with back bone and honesty. I cannot abide a ' smiling  assassin' !
Merck should reduce the amount of ancillary work (department of initiatives) that are change for the sake of change rather than actual improvements.  Then Merck could advance the pipeline better and/or add more projects to the pipeline.  Management should value pipeline achievements over ancillary work (they currently do not).
More emphasis on work-life balance.  All of the colleagues in my division are Type A personalities.  Highly self-motivated and highly productive.  But they are breaking down.  Our boss keeps telling us to be like the airlines:  put on your own oxygen mask first, and THEN help others.  But HE is stretched even farther than we are, and we emulate his behavior.  There are always even more projects that need to be started since we are all at home due to COVID and not traveling.  When everyone was traveling, it was easier to pare everything down to the most essential priorities.  Now it seems that the more projects the merrier, and you can't just say "no" because you are part of a team.  On top of that, our boss' boss has added high time demand trainings and strategy meetings that require months and hours of time.  Again...since we are not traveling, it is assumed that we all have an endless capacity to absorb more projects and ideas.  We don't.  "Business critical" is no longer considered
It is important for Japan MSD to listen to the opinions of the field more, to cherish the employees whose head office is working at the forefront, and to always continue to make the best efforts. There are successes and failures, but not being too enthusiastic about evaluation has a positive effect on the development and development of employees.
1. Stay out of Politics.  If you must be political, do it in a personal way and do not imply that you are speaking for Merck.  The employees of Merck are very diverse and not all agree with any certain political position. 2. Hire the best people for each job, regardless of race or gender.  It seems that we are now entering a time when we have decided to give preference to certain races, in our hiring.  I have zero problem with hiring qualified minorities and have the utmost respect for people of other races.  These type hiring practices are the very definition of racism.  MLK said to judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin.  Good advice.
Free and open communication on the status of the company and future direction
Unfortunately you can't make everyone happy, but I think if we continue to be honest with employees and communicate as much as possible it will help gain the respect from employees that managers need.
flexible working from home options post pandemic realistic workloads and deadlines so healthy work life balance can be maintained dealing with unprofessional colleagues rather than ignoring the behavior employ the right people capable of doing the job that is required of them
Continue to prioritize D&I but also put these principles into place when hiring for leadership positions. Alternatively, proactively groom candidates for future roles in support of D&I initiatives when future positions are open.
Workload for 1st line managers is more administrative and less people leaders/managers. They need to be relieved of some of the administrative burdens to get them time on the shop floor.
Our company needs to continue investments in diseases without stand of care.
Allow all to work from home endlessly, as I personally fear catching Covid or it's strains. Thank you.
MSD is doing an excellent job to be a great place to work, one minor thing I could think of right now is the payment schedule we have here in Costa Rica, it is complicated and it has been complicated, maybe at some point they can reconsider the monthly payment and transform it as a biweekly payment but with the salary divided as 50/50. The other thing I would like to see is more activities to have the Global MRP Tower more united, to work more together and solving issues between regions and not only concentrated in our own region (Americas, EMEA and APAC)
More communications about the future - Paying people of the same pathway with the same salary and having the same benefits - psychological support for this period such as giving access to psychology therapies
When making a decision globally (like with QMS), the leaders have to understand the true impact to work force, ask for and act upon the feedback from the shopfloor.  Respect people's time- meetings should stay on topic (including tier) and should only be held when needed. Make the  "fluff"/additional work
Regarding people: allow people to grow (in depth) within their roles while staying in same department and become an expert in that role (e.g. not every one in a group in job level P2, but also create sometimes a P3 position, and one that not directly is a managing job). Value knowledge. The definition of a successful career is not the same for every one, for one it is becoming a higher manager, while for the other it is gaining more in depth or diverse knowledge on a scientific or other level. This will increase diversity of people within groups and prevent some good experts to be 'forced' in managing roles. Thanks for reading!
Merck needs to keep doing what they have been doing: supporting its people, the profession of veterinary medicine (including all personnel), diversity and inclusion, and acceptance of differences of opinion. The promise of the future and what we will bring to the world is extremely exciting. I wouldn't work for anyone else in Animal Health.
Benchmark against our key competitors within oncology.  We've made some field policy changes that have impact and none of our competitors have followed.  We also have a retention issue and this could hurt us in future recruitment - we were already challenged in finding external talent.   Thank you.
More focus on developing internal talent, no matter the level.
Decrease processes and barriers to take decisions/actions  Promote delegation and growth mindset across all roles  Keep promoting ways of working and diversity & inclusion strategies Keep supporting work-life balance for all roles Showcase examples of how speaking up was valuable for the business and the people involved
Too many priorities.  Company and Leadership has many transformations going on at once and adding more leader roles and not enough worker roles. Many inefficiencies/ineffectiveness built into way projects are executed.
Continue promoting from within the company, to encourage continuity of knowledge, and motivate employees.
Keep focusing on investing in our future pipeline and communicating on our core mission, both internally and externally.
Merck is too processes heavy - we spend 75% of our daily work on either doing trainings on new systems, trying to figure out new SOPs while trying to move activities through those extremely long and complex SOPs. Too many systems, too many metrics, global, local etc.  The bulk of our energy is focused internally as opposed to externally for your customers, our patients! We are not doing what we are supposed to do which is lead in the world of pharma and healthcare.
Don't lose track of your white employees as you continue to stress minority employee advancement.
If we want to be an Agile organization, I think we as an organization need to look at our review process for promotional pieces to streamline the process to expedite time to market.  Currently, ADTs are the model and that's a start but its only a fraction of the number of resources.
Continue the fantastic drive towards diversity. This is definitely the most diverse company I've worked at in my (short) career.   Training and development definitely needs to be improved. I'm within my first year, but surprised at how few development opportunities are presented. It seems that a lot of tasks/projects are assigned to senior members of the group. I understand wanting your best people to complete higher priority objectives; however, from my perspective these senior members are relied on much too heavily. They are working 60 hours/week when we have other, newer colleagues who hardly reach 40 hours. Load leveling and delegating needs to be improved.
Reduce the amount of meetings we have that sometimes doesn't bring added value. Simplify some bureaucratic process that don't need to be so bureaucratic and the simplification does not jeopardize our compliance.
In regard to the question - I have the resources I need to do my job well.  - I have all the resources I need except TIME.  My load is too much. The demand is speed and accuracy, which do not work well together.  Stress is super high.  I want someone outside of Allflex to come in and evaluate the Customer Service Department - jobs.  Merck needs to talk with each Customer Service employee in the department.   We need an overhaul - please.  I love my job.  I love what I do.  I want to do a great job.  And, I want to keep my job.
Merck and MSD should continue to support flexibility for employees as they strive for life/work balance.
Pay their employees what they're worth
Diversity at the highest levels
Discover novel medicines to address unmet disease and health needs.  Prepare the company for the next virus after the COVID-19.  Change the adjuvant in our vaccines to support room temperature storage and viability.  Have a drug for the MERSA and drug-resistant bacteria. Support fair elections and speak out against the voting law changes that aim on suppressing Voting by everyone. Continue to offer the Work from Home even after the pandemic is over.
I love working at MSD, I am proud to be part of this team.  If possible, it would evaluate the possibility of improving health insurance for employees.
Stay out of politics PERIOD.
Quit micromanaging things and listen to the people who do the work to get the resources we need to do the job not waiting on things everyday
Offer advancement opportunities to all employees.
Making professional dev tracks for all roles would be helpful. Or if we would like to make lateral moves within our dept, division or Merck, a resource to assist with how to go about it would be helpful.
New projects compete between each other in relation to availability of site resources.  Steps should be taken to better align important projects when they compete between each others from the corporate level.
Allow ability to continue to work from home for those who wish to continue this post-pandemic.
Continue to push for collaboration across departments and groups, especially if using the same vendors
Streamline workflows and remove impediments to completing routine tasks.
Continue to strive toward a culture of inclusion.   Continue to encourage an open mindset toward change.   Better IT solutions to reduce administrative work and tracking
Sytems need to be continuely upgraded and improved. Either old systems or new launch systems make we (both MSD colleages and collabration site staffs) confused and waste much time on waiting (ex: SIP, InForm...)
Further investment in the organisation to  promote automation to remove manual tasks from the working environment
Standardize employee benefits across the world
continue to engage, motivate, empower and develop  its employee because employee is the important asset to MSD and its mission to save lives of patients by its innovate products
1. Have an acceptable work behavior accord. Treat people with a greater level of respect & value opinions. I have many years experience, but lack of respect afforded to both myself & some of my colleagues could only be described as appalling. 2. Observe work/home life boundaries. 3. Who is HR? Even after working for MSD for a number of years I've no idea where to go to with an HR issue & I do not feel that any issue I may have would not come back on me.   4. Revise extreme hierarchial structure & micro management in some departments, which seems to stifle employees & leaves one with a total lack of power & control over situations. Managers only seem to talk to managers & do not talk to all employees. Requests ignored unless the manager becomes involved in the conversation. Totally waste of time & unacceptable in this day and age. 5. Improve the IT systems, which are not feel user-friendly - slow, cumbersome & overly-complicated globally issued work Instructions are totally baffling
MSD has already made the company a great place to work perfectly; I could not be more confident, happier, and more belonging.
reward those who achieve and appreciate this company and reprimand those who take advantage or deceive this company
while trying to operate within an easy going atmosphere people must be still made to understand there is still a need to work. I feel under performance isn't addressed enough to encourage the the right behaviors of equal ownus /team working and then the burdon lays on minorities in teams to drive results. This should be aknowleged with the inspire programme but in reality we are encouraged to be inclusive and even inspire team members who lack the drive
Create a culture where everyone feel confortable developing themshelf professionally meanwhile respect the family life
Have no tolerance for leadership that views fear and intimidation as motivators for better performance.
"Practice what you preach" - in some instances I have seen the "great place to work" initiatives  as a "tick box" exercise but not actually practiced daily
More sharing information and working together also within the country. I feel I know fairly little what other functions do in our country.
Understand lessons learned from our Covid vaccine failure (both lack of speed in development vs peers and ultimate vaccine ineffectiveness) - we missed a massive opportunity to improve our brand and world health.
Better guidance and reference documents
WIth the move to working more virtually, it would be helpful to provide bandwidth reimbursement so that virtual works can have a reliable and strong connection to the online Merck network
1. Take on board our clients needs more regularly. 2. Reduce the amount of procedures involved with client invoicing structure etc. should be more automated where possible. 3. Admin burden continues to grow so discuss ways this could be simplified.
1. Increase pay to be competitive with other big pharma. 2. Work to decrease turn over. We operate in a culture in oncology that everyone changes roles ever 12-18 months so no one ever knows what they are doing. It is very hard to successfully work in an environment where even leaders are generally unaware of job requirements. It also people in a position where they are "stuck" with each other. There is true meaning behind being hired by someone and being assigned to someone.  3. Please stop moving us arounds like pawns. In the past year my job has changed 3 times--none of which I was particularly pleased with.  4. For employees who now need to work from home due to office closures, pay for our home internet. It only seems reasonable seeing as our home internet is literally the glue holding commercial together. Retro back to March 2020 would be even better, but especially for the teams that will not be going back to the office Merck should align to all remote-based companies' standards
If we want to be the leading Oncology company we have got to be more agile and look to companies that have been doing it well for years and take some notes.
We are strangled by compliance. Lighten up a little so we can compete. Increase salary and bonus for field sales in Oncology. Create a stock option program to reward good performance. "leadership" needs to be honest with themselves, and stop pushing the "total compensation" concept. Step up and PAY good field based employees.....other Oncology companies are doing it.  Allowing people  to work remotely in HQ roles is a good step in the right direction. However, there is no incentive for quality field based employees to take these positions and walk away from a bonus and take a pay cut for  HQ role. adjust the compensation so that when transitioning from a field based role to a HQ role, the pay remains the same.
Put action and money behind the words of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We cannot be satisfied with a 2.5% Black workforce.
Be real.  Doing things for image or political correctness can stall agility and what is best for our company.
i feel Merck has taken the actions needed.  During this pandemic i feel that Merck has put my heath and safety first.
Build and sell great animal and human health products and services.  Do not try to influence employee voting and get recklessly involved in woke culture and politics
1.  Sabbaticals - and not ones that require employees to do job specific function/activity or requires management pre-approval.  If an employee wants to take 3 months off to go learn how to surf or learn French cooking or hike the Appalachian trail then that should be supported. 2.  Promote more job rotations and movement.  In MRL we are too focused on keeping people in function/role.  It is better for long term engagement and employee satisfaction to let employees learn and broaden their perspective of the business.
Increase partnership opportunities
Reinforce that we have a future here and not just an employee that is replaceable or disposable. I.e sell us off to prop up the stock price.
Send in a neutral team to evaluate each site for the issues (good and bad). Have the neutral team select the individuals to meet with and discuss the issues.
We would all like to cover or know everything. That is an unlikely situation. Can Merck make an effort to filter out what is of value/relevance to putting patient's first and what's in best interest of health care?  Too much to know and cover at current pace.
Provide funding for each employee to improve their work-from-home life including items that help with the environment (e.g. standing desk, chair, docking station, etc) as well as funding for better health (e.g. money for outside or home gym equipment)
Support the employees and mission of our company without political bias!
Change is good but all the change that has been imparted on the ExN quality organization with moving job roles and responsibilities around, updating every SOP that we need to do our jobs, implementing new technology and the Organon standup/cross-training all at the same time, is taking its toll on every individual and team that I have been working with.  This in light of what is going on in the world with COVID, politics and social injustice, and juggling family obligations, it is making it hard to stay focused and be positive about our jobs.  Not too many people I am in contact with are very happy.  People are being expected to perform and be proficient with multiple job functions without errors that at other companies in our industry have separate groups or people performing, not just one person.  People seem to be making alot more errors or rush decisions due to all the changes happening at once and not being adequately trained.
To make balance between beast place to work and income budget of employees
Increase recruitment from outside of the industry, particularly in areas like Data and Analytics and Digital Transformation where many other industries have progressed these information sciences well beyond where the pharmaceutical industry has taken them.
More alignment between Global/Region/Countries to have the balance between meetings and other activities that can add more value to our strategies
In setting priorities, it would be interesting to see bottom up feedback of "what i need to do my job better".  Are divisional/corporate priorities and initiatives aligned with what the working level reports as  "needs improvement"?
Keep up the great work!
Flexible work arrangements when it's time to go back to the office.
invest in production workers. continue to modernize train people on new technology from ground up
Listen to the employee more and provide more opportunities to move up.
Ensure the opportunities go for the right candidates
Continue to maintain a positive and friendly working atmosphere
Accelerate the development of new products and maintain competitiveness in the field.
Consider workload and be further open to support employees in balancing the work & life
most important - to reload biurocracy! count how many systems some rolls are required to know and update, how many SOPs we need to read and know - it is not reasonable. second - do we want to be a company that supports balance or to we value results most of anything? please choose a path and declare it clearly, leaving us to decide whether it is suitable for us to work like that. right now we are in the middle, where the "balance" is not felt in our daily work life.
Following the spinoff, take steps to ensure that all divisions are aligned on the Purpose, Mission and Vision of the new Merck/MSD.  There is still so much opportunity to drive effectiveness and efficiency in the way we execute our work...encourage leaders to embrace change, experiment with new ideas/technology and play an active role in coaching the future leaders of our company.
Improving total package
Continue to eliminate non-value added work.
Do not get entangled in politics, focus on the medicine.
Continue to support employees with work life/balance, flexibility, strong employee benefits. continue to grow diversity within the company throughout the levels of leadership.
More development options for those in bands 500 and 600. Some divisions do rotational roles across different depts. well but others not at all
we do need to word towards simplification of processes and systems and ensure we cut down on manual entries/ tracking. technology front needs better support.
Decision should be based on data and evidence rather than intuition.
allowing diversified ways of working, instead of making strict policy to follow.
Listen and take action on feedbacks given.  Explore consensus based decision making instead of top down approach
Respect each employee and make decision of changing people's position/job according to clear rationale, not just depending on manager or HR's impression on employees
Only comments are with respect to delivering on our mission  In my opinion , we should reduce our internal time for change approval process and should make CMC as part of  supply chain organization.  Evaluate and revise Due diligence process for new external partners
Well communicate the purpose and goal of the compay to employees
Work effectively towards Employer of Choice
Considering fact remote working is new normal we need innovative ways to ensure the Engagement  and Motivation of existing employees are sustained as last year was a year of managing the show but future sustainability of same levels of productivity is crucial. The current model is transforming to a very to the point interaction with stakeholders wherein the general awareness of updates and developments with other functional groups are getting diluted leading to employees being singularly focussed on core job and home priorities. New and innovative ways of ensuring new recruits have the same level bonding and feeling of part of the Merck/MSD family while working remotely
Should enhance the field force to penitrate in micro towns and complete cover the peri ferry.
Do people managers training regarding handling people.
More trainings for future leaders
I am missing the drive for the results. Sometimes it is too much talking and less doing.
Regarding family/childcare you could consider a few steps towards being more inclusive of new parents, especially of new mothers whose careers unfortunately take the heaviest hit from having children. My recommendation that I've seen in other companies is to encourage the mothers to come back to work by perhaps offering discounts in nurseries close to the workplace. This way it is more likely that the new mum will be comfortable dropping of her child to the nursery close to work and then going to work rather than debating if she'll stay at home or make other arrangements. Flexible working is also greatly appreciated by new parents!
Provide time to experiment. We are on a day-to-day basis so busy with our activities of the day that we miss time to take a step back and evaluate how we can do things better.
don't hesitate to recognize every people, every function inside the company (for example assistant, support function) and not only "visible" finctuins such as marketing, data, etc.
cross functional and better communication
set up a workweek where there is at least one day with teleconferences
Company needs to be more agile - processes are long winded and can stifle creativity and need to move quickly to changing demands of NHS.
Align "back-end" to "front-end"- i.e. have processes and SOPs that support the planned activities
Better align MRL and MMD to optimize the use of our assets.
Less admin tasks, fewer support functions, mor focus and resources directed at customer interaction
Invest in team cohesion.
better carrier opportunities, easier way to be promoted if excellent worker, easier and more flexible way to create headcount if needed
continue to share more widely in the media about our mission and the important part we have to play
Job rotation, Internships, intrdepartemental collaborations.
Keep engaging with employees on these matters, it is a marathon not a sprint. The needs change over time
Should also consider small countries when thinking of diversity and inclusion.
Flexibility, recognition and training to the employees.
More people manager training on successful team building and meeting facilitation Discussion and recognition that ageism exists at Merck.   20+ year high performing employees at Merck want to continue to be contributors and have the capacity to learn new skills.   Need to redefine the Sales representative role to include policy certifications to be able to engage with customers in more digital platforms
Continue encouraging the workforce to better themselves.
Manager training is key to the success of Merck and MSD.  Managers have a tough job because they need to understand the personalities of their direct reports and try to use this information to help inspire them to be their best!! I have been at Merck for 19 years and have greatly appreciated the quarterly or bi-yearly Skip-level meetings.  It is also important to feel that your voice is heard and have sight to the bigger picture.  By knowing where your work fits into the success of the overall plan is motivating!
Reduce Divisional Silos and great company wide metrics instead of divisional
Improved integrated IT systems and joined up thinking between groups would greatly improve productivity
Keep support programs open for employees, continue flexible workspace for working parents, and keep employees in tune with company updates. Create safe environment for all.
Please launch new and more molecules in India.
Have people managers who focus on the right priorities and who have strong business sense.
Build awareness to everyone to prevent yourself from cancer .
Keep providing updates and where the company is growing
I wouldnt change anything. Merck is handling this difficult time extremely well.
Stop looking at metrics to rely on everything, there is a personnel aspect that is being ignored. Ensure that all levels are getting recognition, it seems to plateau at manager level.  Ensure time for coaching and guidance.   Being told to read an SOP is not coaching.  Ensure better life/work balance.   Too many people are working long days and expect that from their coworkers. Get control of the meetings.   There are way too many meetings with little time to actually work.  Also with Covid there is no consideration for people's basic needs (bio breaks, etc.) especially when some people are on site and other are at  home and can mute themselves and grab coffee, etc.    Training and Development is difficult, especially with high turnovers.   Promote from within the departments should be considered more to keep a sense of stability within the departments.  It doesn't need to be all of the time, but from what I've seen it's frowned upon and lateral moves tend to be the norm.
Offer onsite amenities like a gym and healthy eating classes.
medical plans are below par
Continue leveraging from MPS and digital tools and progressing our diversity and inclusion culture.  The company should evaluate opportunities brought by COVID circumstances that force us to work differently and that could bring efficiencies to the company.  Those should be continued.
Merck is a great place to work, THANKS!
Help enable employees to map out a long term career plan
Reevaluate the external hiring market and increase salaries for current and future employees in order to remain competitive.
Consider working remotely on a permanent basis.
Give a clear direction as to what re-opening of the office will look like.
Continue to support the FLEX policy. Continue to communicate with the employees on the latest status of products developments. Continue to foster an environment of growth and well-being at work.
Continue to invest in people - and our development
I feel the level of flexibility that Merck and MSD allows currently is amazing for working parents.
Continued flexibility and understanding of home-commitments due to pandemic changes in child care.
1. Adjust the pay rate for specialty. The other companies pay at least $30K more for the same position.  2. Cost of living pay adjustments for areas like Northern Ca and the Northwest.  3. You are loosing good people and are unable to hire in these areas because of base pay issues. Of course the mangers voices are not heard on this issue. 4. Disband the bucket bonus payment. It is not a pay for performance. The bonus structure is complicated and compensates poor performance.
provide training to develop and support future leaders
improve communication between marketing and sales on national sales campaigns to simplify processes; more transparent promotion process for new hires
open minded to new technologies, new mindsets and risk taking to be aligned with the industry and to lead the industry
Continue to seek the best and most talented individuals for positions regardless.  Do not get involved in political and social arguments - focus on being the best company we can be.
Already feel the organization is doing this with the recent roll-out of remote working for the future!
I think continuing the flexible work schedule is a great idea
I see so many long-term employees who have wealth of knowledge, but I am not sure if their knowledge has been easily accessible to new employee or shared in the way it helps new employees to grow. I believe in "Sharing" experience, ideas,  knowledge will make teams stronger and will help create positive environment where we all can work effectively,  efficiently without stress.
Continue to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.
Continue to allow remote working
Reinforce the importance of work/life balance.  Working from home has created challenges with balancing life and work. With nearly everyone working remotely our days have become longer and we have more meetings than before WFH.
Clear strategy that is supported and resourced, prioritized innovation and experimentation, embraced WOW
Ensure that the corporate messages of work-life balance and diversity and inclusion get cascaded and "modeled/reinforced" at the local, lower-level management level.
Stay away from choosing sides in politics and work through existing channels to influence causes affecting the business of Merck.
Increase promotion and retention of our talent
stay out of politics
manage the quantity of simultaneous change
it needs to be more people/employee driven,  there are cases in which employee's points of views or ideas are seeing as wrong by superiors and needs to be seen as opportunities to evolve to a greater company, department, region, etc. By doing this our mission may be accomplished and we can make it succeed as a team.
I don't always feel comfortable speaking up at meetings for fear of judgement. The culture and SSF can sometimes feel intimidating. Rather than a scientific discussion it can feel like an argument.
Really really need to work on breaking down silos it's way to cumbersome and while allows the company to assert a minimal risk posture it hinders us from looking at best practices.  This in turn hinders our ability to challenge the status quo.  I've been here a short time but when our team talks about this the same comment is always stated "Welcome to Merck..."
I knew I wanted to retire from this company at the age of 18.  The ethics of this company is never waivered.  I am, and always have been, proud to contribute to the success of this company!  It's a wonderful place to work!
I love this company
It is so important Merck and MSD could support psychological follow up to their employees.
It is very difficult to manuever the current "ever-changing" environment with the level of bureaucracy we have to handle towards the insed of the company. We need to be much more nimble in order to be more proficient in our work and deliver on expectations. Always in a compliant way, but moving faster
continue flexible work from home policies where possible with job function.
Less trainings, less changes in processes, less systems and more time to engage with customers, with the Team, and for self development.
It appears there will be a slow ramp up as we return to the office and it will be important to continue to invest in ways to allow flexibility and career opportunities for those who cannot return full-time to office work immediately.
Resources should always be considered/provided for any additional remediation/ major changes/ multiple concurrent changes
Continue to engage all staff at every level.
Right away i would like to have updates regarding next steps or short term plan related to COVID pandemic.
Make the employee feels appreciated when working in MSD by giving present as a token of appreciation towards the employee especially during this pandemic that hits us very much.
with my current position, i cannot see any future position/promotion for me. this is very discouraging to improve my knowledge/experience on work. MSD should be more flexible and open minded with employees career paths and give more opportunity with cross functional/divisional opportunities.  MSD must be more clear with open position announcements and hire employees (number/ grade/location) in line with announcement.
focus more on major objectives, less on non-significant procedural uniform
I think that following steps can save and improve MSD as great place to work: - to save and promote diversity politics  - to expand opportunities for relocation between different departments and countries for employees. - to use and implement elements of Agile methodology in internal business processes  - to explore new IT technologies as blockchain, regtech, smart contracts, etc
I feel there is so much great work going on in Merck and often see some great press releases on Financial Platforms that dont be communciated down. Also there is not a whole lot of information in the Merck pipeline which would be great to see. List of products and the clinical stages which they are at.
Make work more efficient and less time consuming
Reduce complicated or duplicated work or process, focus more on result of each project instead of number of project. shift talk to talk to walk to walk culture, more empathy and empower can build the sustainable achievement to the company.
Continue to build out pathways for talent developments and competency pathways.  Ensure appropriate compensation benchmarking internally and externally.
Look for additional strategies to balance work/Family life, since sometimes is difficult.
Need to work as 'ONE' Company.  Experiencing 'SILO' mentality, with some areas implementing software not evaluated for Global use.
I feel Merck does a good job making this a great place to work. I do, however, feel that since we have been doing all our meetings and trainings digitally, I have lost touch with the personal aspect of interacting with employees. It has been over a year since I have seen any Merck employee in person and I don’t like that. I need to have personal interaction to feel connected to my team.
I think the company does a good job with providing resources for inclusion and feeling safe to speak up, but I am not so sure employees in a position of leadership openly practice according to those resources. I think many still don't feel safe to speak up because of previous bad experiences and its easier to just stay off the radar. I think employees really question if things have changed in terms of safety in speaking up if someone had a bad experience in the past.
Merck is a complex organization with many stakeholders and opinion leaders, but few decision owners.  New governance models are advertised to be a streamlining and a 'pushing down' of decisions and strategy, but seem to have only resulted into less frequent, all day, meetings. There has not been a visible change, just a shift into a new schedule for the previous process.  In order to make actual progress, SMEs and project level teams need to be empowered to make decisions and execute on those decisions.  Current structure has project teams focused on scenario planning, while still relying on governance for 'permission.'
How about a summer shutdown? Amgen has the 4th of July week observed as a company wide shut down (similar to the winter one). This could be a great benefit as many would love this week off anyways and don’t need to use their vacation time. Most of our customers are off this week or too busy with coverage for their coworkers to meet with us.
Promote from within in MMD. There is an awful disconnect between mid/upper management and their subordinates. There seems to be no empathy for lower level managers and their workers in regard to the work that has to be done, and it is especially prevalent during this pandemic.
Keep working form home still possible.
Vaccinate your people!, give more global opportunities to work abroad.
This is a great company to work in. Work life balance is not just spoken to but actively embraced. I chose my current role - not necessarily because of the topic but the manager as there was a good connection at the interview stage and I received great feedback from her colleagues. I have not been disappointed with my decision. Strong leadership encourages you to strive to achieve great things and I feel in that position in my current role. Having the opportunity to do an above country role from your home country provides increased opportunities for career growth and encourages ambition.  As stated above, MSD overly engineers many processes, to the point that we can be left behind with external opportunities especially when engaging with SLs. Thankfully the environment exists to openly acknowledge this and try to overcome the barriers. However, a broader examination of this would be useful to excel our external engagement opportunities, especially in a virtual world.
As an organisation I feel support funtions shouldbe taken more seriously in terms of budgetand headcount to enable the business to deliver upon its objectives. We deliver great results consistently nomatter what the workload brings and this I feel gets to a point where our people leave or burn out. M&A activity is a good example of where the business should be open to and supportive in financial and Headcount resourcing to allow for us to support without comprimising employee wellbeing.
Continue to be patient-centric, while really taking care of its employees and retaining talent, especially affording the African American and Latino employees with opportunities for advancement
Be more proactive and timely to market events.  We take tooooooo long
Work with GD&I to increase awareness of the ways of working and partner with Best Buddies to open jobs to those with intellectual disabilities.
Considering the pandemic and working from home, Merck should provide reimbursement for internet / cell phone.  Merck should allow time in our work day to develop skills related to technology advancement.  Some of our systems seem antiquated, yet we don't have the time in our day to explore new ways of working.
I’m hopeful our new CEO Robert Davis will focus on driving business growth, and search for great opportunities to enhance our product pipeline.  I also hope he avoids political statements regarding any form of social justice campaign.  As a Merck employee, I don’t want to be associated with a political position.  I want to be respected by customers, and fairly compensated based on my annual contributions, and not based on my sex or skin color.
SEGUIR TRABAJANDO EN PRO DE LA SALUD, APOSTAR A LA INOVACION DE NUEVOS MEDICAMENTOS PARA SALVAR VIDAS, SEGUÍ TRABAJANDO EN LA INCLUSIÓN Y RESPETO DE LAS PERSONAS, ME ENCANTA SU FILOSOFÍA Y COMO CUODA A SUS EMPLEADOS.
The organization, searchability, and accessibility of quality documents is not only embarrassing, but in direct conflict with the companies desired compliance culture. Too many individuals don't know how to find what documents govern their work, and even when they do, they often struggle to search for them or access them.  People are encouraged to speak up when they see opportunities for improvement, but often all of the time/effort to exact change falls on the individual which can overwhelm people and prevent them from speaking up in the future. Management could improve how they recognize and support potentially impactful ideas for change.
foster on D&I
Further empower employees so that decision making happens at the right levels. Support employees so that they can achieve a good work/life balance including providing flexibility to work remotely depending on their job function.
more resources required to give a better customer service experience particularly around Direct by MSD. We need more resources in the CS team to cope with demand from customers, we need more specialist resource in the COBU teams to support the various systems and processes to ensure these are completed in a timely manner to ensure customer satisfaction when problems arise. We need better communication processes with our customers when there are issues
They always keep everyone up to date about everything and always make sure everybody is safe & well especially during Covid.
eliminate bureaucracy and complicated procedures.
Since we're working from home now, would like to have internet data allowance
Process/system simplification
Continue investing in culture of inclusion and diversity. Hold all employees accountable for their work. The biggest problem with unconscious bias is NOT the harm to minorities (lack of promotion, opportunities, etc.). The biggest problem is the work and decisions of white males are NOT questioned enough. And when flawed thinking and decisions are left unchecked (because of bias - "must be good"), the organization suffers. I've witnessed this first hand here at Merck and MSD! As a minority, i don't mind being challenged, questioned, etc. if it makes me better and of course i expect opportunities and recognition as a result. This message is not heard enough, i intend to push it.
Allow more time for work at work with less meetings/metrics to allow employees to achieve a work life balance.  Narrow down all the metrics to a few KPIs that are attainable and able to be focused on and that really capture the health and success of the sites.
Fix your AIP. I'm saying this here because I have nowhere else to say it -- I worked from early July through March straight, with a total of 2 weekend days off (so worked every weekend during that period other than 2 days, and worked through Christmas and Thanksgiving). I did this because I was highly committed to delivering value and reducing risk to Merck via my first-in-kind project -- this project was a not a slam-dunk with 100% assurance of success. I executed both tangibly and directly, saving $$$ for one technical resource, and making sure my project ran without risk & ahead of schedule. As such, it didn't have most of the drama that many projects at Merck seem to have. This was a mistake - as a result, my reward for this level of commitment was a mid-level AIP grade. This is not about me (I know I outperformed) and it's not about my managers either (there were so few slots available that their hands were tied too). I'm a retention risk now & taking my talent with me. Good luck.
When it comes to departmental decisions, those in higher administration roles are the ones making the calls that will affect everyone under them. These decisions don't affect these administrators but can have drastic affects on the work life of those in the department. I would like to see major decisions take into account the thoughts of the employees who will actually be doing the work, not just some shit rolls downhill and we're at the bottom and have to deal with it type of mentality. I've experienced this personally multiple times across a couple different roles within the company.   The Company has a terrible habit of polishing turds, ie, fixing problems with band aids instead of permanent solutions. This causes great limitation with the work that needs to get done. An example would be that some buildings do not have the infrastructure to allow for some of the ideas that the higher ups are pushing onto those working under them but the lower level employees have to deal with it.
embrace technology to accelerate growth.
Compensation
Making the hiring process less onerous on the hiring manager and more streamlined in getting new hire set up immediately before and at time of starting...it can take weeks to get actual hiring process complete even when candidate has been identified and accepted role  Continue to educate on digital business tools available, a lot of tools are there but hard to know that and learn how to really get value when also managing day-to-day role....
Listen to both sides of the argument.  Or better yet, please keep this corporation stay out of politics.  The US is divided along political lines, so taking a side is problematic. Your employees are divided as well (on both sides). My advice is: Just stick to the science (which we are good at) and do not criticize people that do not see it the way you do. Those that do not take vaccines is NOT evil. They may be waiting to get more data and should not be stigmitized or forced take part in health passport.  Your health is your choice. We are about helping people (not turning ppl away). George Merck's mission is what we should focus on, rather than any concept that is vogue by main stream media (eg BLM, critical race theory).
Working at MSD Upper Hutt does not feel like I am working for MSD Global. There is a disconnect between our site and corporate, and there seems little to no interest from either party to address this. We do not have the systems in place to do our jobs effectively, and the corporation is not supplying the resources required to ensure we are compliant with MSD procedures and standards.
True diversity mindset and improve the qualifications and the  emotional intelligence of the management.
Allowing more opportunity for social virtual engagement on the district level and more Regional Point calls.  Engagement is needed now more than ever, since we are unable to meet for in-person district/regional meetings and most are 1-up territories.
More simplification on processes and more focus on serving external customers rather than internal customers
change the culture from short to long-term
1.Need to a create a place where employee can speak without any fear. 2.Need to create mechanism where mid level managers can be held accountable for their work. 3.At this point MSD is behaving like an autocratic organisation having said that autocracy always breeds corruption.
Culture of openness to value feedback and ideas
Have nothing to add. Thank you.
Already doing well
Continue to focus on the importance to balance work/after work for employees wellbeing. Simplify processes that keep our attention and energy inside company, to get more time and energy to look outside our company, to medical communities, KDMs, patients communities, civil society, other relevant associations to make things better in HC
To be more Customer  focus company Gocud From MSD to Customer
Managers to develop competence in giving feedback,  greater support of employees development, greater engagement with colleagues, develop self-awareness , develop an unbiased and growth mindset .
I think Merck, as a leading biotech pharma, could be more involved in the global fight against coronavirus.  The virus is unfortunately here and it will remain for some time
Be more in tune with the companies that they acquire and how these businesses operate so as to ensure that they have everything they need from the get go
Have a clear career progression set in place for all employees to keep them motivated and engaged in their role
Create a work environment where people want to continue to work with MSD long term.
I think the ways of working need to be more present also in the leadership team. Currently it feels like going back to silos rather then networks and the communication of changes is getting worse
1. In country engagements we need more of them and must be interactive.  Strategy of the company being presented more to the whole company so that every one understand their role in implementing the strategy and achieving it. Every department need to also be strategy focused and measure every quarter how far they are to strategy what the barriers and the wins are   More collaborative working  Leadership engagements and mentorship programmes needs to be visible and their successes celebrate. Leadership to try be visible in this digital times
Improve communication between departments. Eliminate the use of Micromanagement tools (Daily Updates/SmartQC), as they make employees feel like they aren't being trusted to do their jobs, and only serve to increase anxiety
Follow-up with employees who have been the target of psychotic work place bullies.
Utilize an external consultant and conduct in-depth analysis of the health and wealth of AA and LatinX US employees.  Share the results with employees and facilitate a reconciliation process.  Then, take the lead of others in BioPharm (like Pfizer, Gilead, etc) to create a process that will address the inequities in a SMART way, with consistent feedback and tracking of progress.
Thank you for taking the time to listen via this survey. I believe we need a focus how we incent and the systems we have in place that are truly driving our culture. We are still in need of more of a mindset shift from silos to networks. People are still rewarded and act on furthering their project and their division versus stepping back and making decisions for the greater good. We still spend time overthinking and over-engineering projects, and the volume, length, weight of the output is what is rewarded versus a measure of what it did for the organization.  We would benefit from a resourced and operationalized process that allows full enterprise deployment, measurement and sustainment of initiatives. Our reliance on volunteers and development opportunities to drive key cultural elements such as moving towards a more diverse and inclusive culture remains stalled because of lack of sponsorship and a true enterprise commitment.
Help employees in mantain a good work-life balance. Be more rigurous to everyone respect a short work day on fridays for example.
Work on a digitalization strategy for Animal Health and apply MPS consistently, now we throw them overboard the moment it becomes uncomfortable.
Continue to improve our systems  (especially in improving the change control system) and invest at our manufacturing sites (ensuring we have capability of making in-house buffers instead of outsourcing them, which adds cost and supply risk)
need manager  to not show favor to some people more need other.  need manager to come out of office and see what going on  for them self and not letting leader tech tell them ever thing.  went you go to them and they said they are to busy to talk about issues in  the lab.
Create a more structured performance review and active management of employee career paths
Stop forcing people to work and hold people accountable for not showing up to work without appropriate notice. Be upfront about the work expected prior to hiring. Comfort of employees is important but stop restricting our actions so much that it makes us stop being who we are. Find ways to improve modernization of our manufacturing processes to reduce paperwork errors. We can still achieve GMP without having to write everything down on paper with initial and date. Computer systems are wonderful and should be utilized to reduce that kind of paper waste and would still allow us to track corrections with an appropriate system in place.
Increase the Operations work force.  Occasionally I get a sense of "overwhelm" among the staff, as we are extremely busy with increasing workload while some staff are out or impaired (off site) with covid-19.
They need to get off this buddy system of hiring and hire the best candidate for the job. We pass over a lot of talented people for people in positions of power to hire their buddy and try to train them up when there is a more qualified candidate. We also need to promote experienced people a lot of time people get passed over for jobs because they don't have a degree that have a ton of experience in the subject matter and the process and end up training the new hire.
B transparent about restructuring and our future.
Flexible arrangements regarding remote work.
Continue to listen to its employees closest to the processes on how best to improve. INVEST IN IT!!! Our systems and architecture are antiquated.
Continue to make available remote jobs/gigs for individuals who are unable to move but have skills & talents to offer in roles they aspire toward for career development.
Address burn-out across organization
Actually start making changes and not just talking about it.  We have a diversity and inclusion VP and team, and I found out about it after years of being with the company.  If there is no real intent to actually address the root cause, then do not do anything.  Focus on this like we focus on long term health of the company, stop chasing the short term headline moves.
I am a new hire not appropriate to comment at this point
Listen to it's employees.  Continue to let employees work from home even after things get better.  We have proven it can be done efficiently.
Really practice what we preach about work life balance and mental health
Generating new drugs to save lives and Building internal Opportunities.
Bring new products
Let’s have new products in our CVM basket
Should come with more new products, understand the market need ,pls do not put our strategies to our customers which they don’t need, make sop after consider the market need, pls promote internal growth.
Should have a good pipeline of products to make the employees feel confident . Employees should be aware of the future and pipeline products .
Don't use short term employees, but focus on creating a sustainable team. So that the working environment is stable and coherent.
Ensure that employee's are supported in their (achievable) goals. Taking in consideration not just the company goals. But also acknowledging that supporting employee goals, that might not have 100% overlap with company goals, can lead to a happier and as such more efficient and dedicated employee.  Additionally it should thread carefully on the diversity and inclusion area. While diversity and inclusion is very important, brute forcing such matters might lead to unintentional inequality.
Stakeholders to be given free hand like in pre 2019 era to make decisions 2020 start onwards, decision making is taken by MD only, seems he doubts the ability of our employees to take decision.
Remain consistent. Do what we say we were going to do.
To help all countries in current pandemic. To take initiative to  research and production of COVID vaccine.
at CVM team we are currently dealing with only one product... need new products or solution to serve patients in better way.
Listen & apply to employees feedbacks to make work environment better
Maximum entries coverage with effective & updating knowledge of improving field force
Continue on the path Leadership has provided and make adjustments when necessary.
MSD Animal Health India  Company very good customer faithfully service and communication villages area and town  The regular deliver mission and goals
Competitive pay for retention. Similar companies in the area offer higher pay, stock options, matching etc for similar roles. HR initiated market adjustment meets the bare minimum low range.  Employees loyal to company with long tenures paid significantly less than external hires for the same role.  Role change promotions pay increase capped even when competing with external colleagues for the same role.
Continue to hire people with a mindset that is open to different POVs and that are hard working.
Stop penny pinching in discovery.  Focus on impowering your best employees (THE most important in discovery) rather than how to improve your avg. to worst performers (all are needed, but only a few will change the future).
Continue to develop life saving products with a diverse and talented workforce, and continue to reward competitively with the marketplace.
Refresh the Senior Leadership Team onsite at MSD Brinny to bring new perspectives and different experiences to site.
With the increase of production in most areas, it would be nice to have enough people to complete our daily tasks. We have requested help many times and are told no or nothing at all. We are a small department that is trying to keep up with the increase of production, but is difficult when there are only 4 of us. We have no support of other departments, and are on call to their demands, which are increasing more each day. We have space issues and this is being ignored. We are getting up there in age and it is difficult to physically work at the pace that is required to preform our daily duties. Oh well!!! Just do your best right? We here this too often.
I don't like to see the company take positions that can be viewed as partisan.  As a company, we should stay very far away from the political stage, except for the PAC.
Continue being transparent; eliminate the RAT tool
Provide more resources for the M1s in animal health, and improve talent diversity.
To do some adjustments to the way we are working, following the COVID 19, like hybrid work. Working few days from home and few days at the office. Continue to keep work-life balance.
Understanding the progress and great scientific achievements can only be made if the overall infrastructure is in place and upkept long-term. By infrastructure meaning 1) analytical, chemical and general lab equipment, 2) proper functioning IT at work and at home (for WFH) 3) proper knowledge capture about workflows, safety and equipment use.  Scientist waste a lot of time on a day to day basis because little focus is given to these areas compared to the scientific achievement that can be immediately celebrated internally during end of the year evaluations or on social media. With a proper infrastructure, scientist would be better able to adapt to the ever increasing speed of programs.
bring daily expectations and work load to a more realistic level, especially when applying changes towards remote work
Process simplification, less hierarchical and clarification of roles and responsibilities between global, regional versus countries personnels to ensure efficiencies and avoid duplications (middle person syndrome)
There should be a similar system in terms of treating HCP across all business units. We represent MSD despite promoting different products but HCPS see us as MSD and not by product. Hence, it would be great to have an alignment.
Modify how the year end review meetings are conducted. I have received feedback from multiple years now in which managers in the review meetings are actively targeting me to be placed in the lower bucket. I think the review process needs to be reframed because we should not be targeting people to deem them as low performers when they are not, only to satisfy some HR criteria. These same people who behind closed doors are trying to throw me under the bus are the same folks who to my face will say "great job" so it's completely disingenuous really hurts morale.
Gulf leaders need to implement the global guidance in sharing the standards of MSD global. They tailored there ways here to look ok, but they don’t follow MSD global
A more strict and robust absent policy, too many call outs that make scheduling a nightmare!!!
There is a lack of Human Resource accessibility and interaction. I am fairly new to Merck and at times I have been hesitant and unsure of where to go with personal questions.
12 mos. is a long time to stay in a position that is not a good fit. Working with a great team and a good manager, only goes so far when working with a director that is causing more stress than alleviating. People skills should be lesson one for directors. Expecting people to perform new tasks without training and complete with in tight timelines, but are also required to deliver service on demand to customers, causes unnecessary stress. Expectations are causing even more experienced team members to feel as if they can no longer handle the job, much less new team members.
Pay us as well as or better than competitors to avoid losing our colleagues with institutional knowledge to other organizations.
Leadership should strongly consider making roles remote/work from home (WFH) or increase the frequency of WFH. While this has been done during the pandemic, I think there is opportunity for employees to maintain better work/life balance when WFH. Additionally, competitors are moving to make roles 100% remote. Talent retention may be an issue if this isn't explored further. Separately - digital technologies being implemented for Deviation Management (QN at a Glance) are not really valuable to me. I have an easy to update spreadsheet that is much more user friendly and faster to use. I have shared with the DM above site team.
MSD should appreciate their personnel and give reward and salary according to workload and responsibility. This should be the same throughout the Site; differences between departments on the same site should be smaller.
Continue to support flexibility for all employees!
Support development and retention of high-performing employees through promoting in place.
Continue to solicit feedback as corrective actions are put in place to improve on areas identified by these surveys. Often times, survey results are received, actions are put into place but we don't close the loop to come back and see if the actions led to the intended improvements.
To continue the effort of being inclusive and cultivate growth mindset
I think there are lots of job openings where the posting description is written narrowly, with just one preferred candidate in mind.  I would make sure that posted jobs are truly competitive, and not "written for somebody".
To understand what we need and what management could do
continue the culture of recruiting from within
It is still unclear to me how some people are promoted in my department, particularly those who have challenging workplace personalities that can undermine a team-based culture. There seems to be a lot of middle men involved in the leadership chain. Although I have a great manager now, there are many politics in place, and I don’t always feel safe to speak up with other leadership.
Eliminate obstacles and barriers to change.  Many companies are adapting new ways of working during the pandemic, and while Merck has adapted well, Senior Leaders are not supportive of required changes going forward to keep pace with and be innovative in the way we work.  Merck is behind the curve in announcing and adopting changes to the workplace and workplace flexibility.  Significant cost savings opportunities exist by rightsizing our workplaces in the right locations.  People no longer need to be tied to a desk or offices, or even specific workplaces.  Senior Leaders need to support and advocate for change, thinking about how their teams have worked differently over the past year and how Merck can holistically apply these learnings to make the workplace more efficient and effective to support the long term needs of our patients.
Large, over arching policies that are made with out representatives from all areas do not work. They leave out critical information and a convoluted, due to being dulled down to support multiple areas
Continue to purchase or create innovation that fills an unmet need.  I believe if our company successfully does this then it will weather the pricing pressures that are coming our way and protect jobs.  I believe Merck’s name has been used too much for political reasons, I believe Merck should remain politically neutral and stick to the business of Merck.
Better communication between recently acquired entities and MSD regarding operational procedures and processes.  Training newly acquired entities on systems that are utilized and also training current MSD employee's better ways to communicate so that we are not lost in acronyms.
Continue to provide relevant products and resources for providers that will improve patient care and treatment options, growth in clinical trials, and balance of compliance and field-facing team productivity should be on-going.
We recognize compliance is necessary to help us be successful and to keep us safe. It would be helpful if compliance and sales leadership could form task forces including reps from across divisions to give input on how policies and restrictions will impact the field. It has been a long time since many in leadership have worked in the field and the majority of compliance people have never worked in the field as reps to understand the impact of decisions in today’s environment. Unfortunately, we don’t hear about these decisions until they have already been finalized and become policy. We share our feedback, but it does not feel like it is heard nor can anything be done to change it at that point. Many of these policies are organization wide and are tough to change once they are stamped with approval. Please take into account the environment in each, individual sales division. They are different and your decisions impact the divisions differently in many instances.
Being part of MSD family, found to be blessed with good culture and people around me for every support. Great place to work on the planet.
more appreciation award for staff, more flexible benefits such as including vacation and increasing amount of coverage, face to face teambuilding among local function and local-regional-global function within same function / different function
A bit of more stability. I know that the environment changes and we need to adapt to it and be flexible, but sometimes org changes make projects just started outdated
Embrace New people Culture.  More training resources Use trello as account planning tool Use docu sign
Facilitate Covid-19 vaccination for MSD employees  Increase the schooling allowance in Oman
support and give opportunities to people who have an interest in growing within the business
. Make SOP's less complex and ambiguous, particularly around meetings and activities with HCP's . Steamline SOP's between Commercial and Medical where appropriate - We are one company after all . Minimise bureaucracy with administration. . Improve upon true department partnering and collaboration from the outset, rather than being brought in late to projects, ensuring all key stakeholders are involved for best outcomes.
support learning and create opportunities
Stay strong as now and trust people who are working in the company. This is a great place to work with a great mission behind and in the future
Prioritise ruthessly Ensure equal distribution of work across groups based on headcount and available resources less focus on strategy and more focus on culture
View employees as humans who have a life and priorities outside of work. Continue to focus on flexibility and work-life balance and supporting employees emotionally during stressful times.
Please help Sourcing with MDG they are slow and causing a lot of stress.
For Leadership to continue to think and see outside the box
Better organization of internal process and establish a more updated mindset of promoting internal talents
Continue attracting, hiring and retaining top talent in senior leadership roles, stress company mission and vision in tone from the top.
Actively coach and develop people.
Enable remote working full time
Focus on key talent development and match the right talent to the right roles based on skill set / ability.
Merck thus far has been one of the best places I have ever worked. Very transparent and informative.
Prioritize work and resource the priorities, to include lower priorities being deferred and not resourced
SAP  is the global standard CMMS system used at MSD . I use SAP currently for Quality notifications and Maintenance Management. The use of SAP is cumbersome and  requires  a large amount of  resource  hours for   simple tasks and changes. I think are opportunities to be made in this space.
Collaborate with the SME's. Reward employees for finding major flaws. I found a major computer flaw two years ago and have yet to receive any acknowledgement or compensation.
Continue to enhance customer engagements, remain competitive in the marketplace, continue to adapt to an ever changing work environment, continue to recognize and award employees, be competitive when it comes to pay and benefits
I absolutely loved being able to work from home and found that I can better manage my work and home life. I am not gone 12+ hours a day anymore (the commute to Madison is a long one) and has had a positive impact on my family life. I would love the option to keep working remote for the PV department.
Do a better job with communications.  Why are employees not the first to know about big news, for example that Merck's Covid vaccine attempt was halted or that Merck agreed to partner with J&J to manufacture their vaccine.  These communications should be sent to employees first; I shouldn't be hearing them on the news or from friends/family for the first time.
A lot of people are overloaded and in many cases, only the necessary things can get done.  This leaves little time for improvements and frustration when asked to implement new systems.  Many people are working more hours spilling into the evenings and weekends.  I believe more people should be hired to spread out the workloads.
Succession planning on the manager level.  When someone leaves there is a gap with no one to step in and a long time to get someone to the level they should be.
Consider making flex work arrangements that we have been using during Covid restrictions a permanent change, that allows for people to be able to more easier manage work/life balances without the concerns of commuting to and from work everyday, when alot of our daily work can be managed remotely.
I think there needs to be  a collective way for our whole organization to really celebrate our accomplishments, our hard work, our resilience.  not in individual rewards but a way we can all be in one collective moment together. We haven't had that for so long and it feels like it's time. The thank yous from leadership have been really encouraging but how can we really stand together and say 'we did this in the past year together and now we know we can keep on going?'
Continue to offer flexibility when possible to allow work/life balance.
Enable more resources so that employees can both perform their job well, but also achieve stretch goals and development opportunities. Current state is such that people are stretch too thin, and by default feel they arent able to take advantage of  opportunities that may fit in to their  development plan. The balance of this is off center.   Changing this dynamic will foster better ambition and desire, enable team members to give full attention and focus to the job at hand, move away from the permanent state of multi tasking,  and keep growing / expanding with the company.
Continue to ensure the culture stays the same as more people join, and the same focus from management on keeping this culture that has been developed since start up.
I think for the onboarding process there should be both a mentor and a buddy, a mentor to teach merck work processes and help in a technical sense and a buddy to help with the smaller day to day aspects.
Provide visibility into how the business divisions work together, promote development opportunities for older employees, and provide clear career roadmaps.
Improve work life balance for employees. Provide healthy food at the canteen.
-Fostering collaboration and team performance in the areas that need it (individual performance is what is rewarded mainly) -Decentralize decision making and empower people to make more decisions on their own. Centralization is very disruptive and slows down improvements -Careful with extremely stretch goals (zero audit issues, zero mistakes, 100% quality ) they may promote dissatisfaction and low psychological safety (people too afraid of making mistakes)
Being customer focus like other Biological companies are. i.e. vaccine shipments from one day to the next day.  The time (approx. 2 weeks) that it takes to sign up a customer to a PO or Vaccine Brand Choice before the customer can start ordering. Price sensitive.
The company is a Global leader in Vaccines , however we do not have a program at subsidiaries to provide Vaccines to the employees .
Reduce redundancy in different Hoshin Challenges and have better overview of all linkages. Ensure new systems are evaluated thoroughly to determine whether it is beneficial for the end-users at all global sites before deciding on a global implementation.
Resourcing is big issue at my site. There is heavy workload and very tight timelines, Quality decisions are not always prioritised due to this.
I don't know of any thing as we speck just in the short time I've been here its been GREAT I luv my job and look forward to doing great things and hopefully moving up later on with more responsibility. I,m very thankful for the opportunity and look forward to the future here.
Never forget that taking care of people matters
Interaction with my manager has become pretty limited and it's somewhat confusing. 1:1s have stopped since EOY 2020. At the moment, I feel deflated and without a clear path forward to the next level. My work seems fruitless while I see others with less experience be celebrated and recognised. It's a bit frustrating. I am considering alternative roles.  There should be a development structure in place in my group, so that those with sufficient experience that work hard are pushed to the next step.
Make Business Units Heads  and all employees accountable for business results and deal with them when they fail. Create fair recruitment process for internal employees and eliminate favoritism in Country. Employees who have no proven track record, have not achieved any tangible business results get promoted faster than others. People are made to apply whilst leaders know who they want to appoint. Leaders claim to be strategic and progressive yet they fail to achieve budget, have no understanding of pharma business, run change in a unilateral manner, dictate on how things should be done, praise themselves for having done well when there are gaps. Create 360 for all leaders so that we can make input on how they manage/lead. We need authentic leaders like in Country. There is a lot happening you are not aware of. Conduct constant business reviews virtually and get input from teams. create objective feedback mechanism. We have micro managers that to claim to be leaders.
Company should provide the four wheelers for field colleagues for safety purpose.
Morale in the cattle division, quite frankly is not great. We have seen a lot of talented people leave, and I think a lot of that comes from being locked down on Covid restrictions - seems like people left Merck to go to work at a place that would let them do their job. I understand that the restrictions are meant to protect us and our customers, but they seem to me, to be extreme and too far-reaching. Our customers are hungry for in-person meetings and I hate to think that it will probably be our competition that is able to give them that experience before we are able to. The recent Diversity & Inclusion training quite honestly made me feel like my company thinks I am biased against people who don't look like me. I am not a part of this demographic, but I honestly feel like the most discriminated against person in Merck right now is the middle aged white male. I'm trying to be candid but also not too blunt here, but this is how I feel.
Mission is great. I am proud to be working for Merck but there needs to be more ground level focus on employee development to retain talent and experience within the company. Take a survey on people manager, departmental leadership to assess satisfaction level
Reduce internal bureaucracy and empower middle managers to make decisions
Continue with its drive for excellence in research to discover and develop new medicines and keep a strong focus of diversity, inclusion, and developing its employees. I wish that Merck had this positive environment 10 years ago when I began working for Merck. I think that the more that Merck shows that it cares about its employees the more that Merck will receive from its employees.
Offer as much support to sales reps as possible. We are facing burn out and lots of pressure to push new products and implement the new services all at the same time.
Clearly communicate resources for training and professional development.
Continue to offer flexible work arrangements. For employees that can do their job remotely, consider keeping the majority of working days remote.
Continue to allow more flexibility to work from home after we return to the office.
decrease time for new product development for animal health-
Strong commitment to Science!
great future and pipeline - however, foresee challenging Pnl for 2021-24 outside vaccines and oncology for most of world
Uncertain about MSD's future. Not any large blockbuster drugs in the pipeline and Keytruda's patent will be expiring soon which could result in significant revenue loss.
I am fearful of the direction we are headed as an organization.  We, as much of the country, are embracing Marxist Critical Race Theory and are pushing it on our employees.  In this way of thinking, everything is about race, everything is about putting people into groups.  You are either a member of the oppressor group, or a member of the oppressed group, and this is based on your skin color, gender, or some other victim category.  Marxists are great at tearing things down and awful at building anything up.  This is the direction of our nation and we have fully embraced this as an organization.
Great 2025 plan for future!
I think the company is diligent in pursuing new opportunities
Strong vaccine pipeline is very encouraging for our future and for the communities we serve.
I feel that conducting science is becoming increasingly inhibited by elements of outsourcing and conservative interpretation of some regulatory, safety, or procurement requirements.  We are not as agile as we once were.
I can only speak for the department I am in.  It is very supportive of individual growth.
Little concerned about over reliance on vaccines and oncology
I'm excited about the future of MSD, however I'm worried with the upcoming LoE impacts.
I don’t see our company being willing to meet the competitive challenges we see in the field with solutions
We always seem to have something in the pipeline, but very few come out.
The financial impact of the pandemic continues to be a lasting concern
We have incredible opportunities ahead of us, especially as we look to build a new approach to animal health that combines traditional biopharma with technology.  There will be challenges but I am very excited about the future.
How Merck's direction will be after Organon spin off? for re-restructure esp. office based and people retention (as many talents left to Organon).
Exited to see the conpany grow in Ireland
I am really excited about Merck and MSD future considering strong development pipeline as well as fortify the organizational goals. I am very excited to see how we are impacting the life's of our patient by reimagining the medicine and the classic example is Keytruda. Also, development molecules for COVID will definitely make positive impact to suffering humanity.
I think Merck Corp leadership needs to stay out of politics
I am concerned that the Compliance arm of Merck is going to run us out of the business.  The tools given to us to "improve our compliance" need more resources to maintain and many times don't handle the whole job.  As a result, a site is maintaining now 2 systems instead of the one that they had prior to changes dictated by QSIP.
Merck continues to be held back by simple requests. Working virtual displays without a proper landing page. Just webex with Merck employee photos. We need to step up and stop having legal control items that are low risk but make us look unprofessional
It has become impossible for reps to conduct their business. There are so many unreasonable restrictions that we have to cancel appointments and hold back on opportunities. There are too many reps in Oncology and now that we can only have 12 meals per year per customer, the coordination process has become ridiculous. Also, not allowing for alcohol at dinner programs in the future, will make it so customers will not attend them. It’s already difficult to drum up enough attendees as it is. We are losing reps to other companies where they can conduct their interactions with customers and sell their products with reasonable guidelines around those interactions and less reps to coordinate with. They also are strongly financially incentivized with larger bonuses and RSUs.
Concern about pipeline and impacts of pandemic together with Organon spin off in terms of cost reduction.
every contract we have more taken away from us, not excited at all
I would like to see Merck streamline processes and move forward in R&D and be aggressive about buying companies with promising medicines or process improvement avenues.  Be science driven in nature
It makes me a little nervous that we have so much tied into Keytruda.  Also a little disappointed that we were so far behind the Covid 19 vaccine as we are one of the few vaccine companies. I hope we can continue to bring new to market and innovative products.
I feel the Merck Management team is truly focused on being a good corporate citizen and working to show that they value their employees.
I'm excited to see what comes through our pipeline, especially in oncology and biologics. I am nervous for when Keytruda goes off patent, and it has been disappointing recently with the announcements for cancelling the V-590, V-591, and MK-7110 programs
The last year feels like Merck didn't follow through on what we talk about "industry leading, influencer in pharma, etc" as it related to the pandemic response.  Pfizer definitely was able to move and deliver in alignment with the mission that we communicate....and now they are investing in a paradigm-shifting approach to vaccine development.  Feels like Merck is falling behind on this front.  I have lots of concerns about Merck's Discovery engine.  Low productivity, limited success.  It seems like a significant review/overhaul is required here.  I have concerns about how our company manages through post-Keytruda expiry.
I am a bit unsure of the plans for the next few years post Organon split and the failure of the Covid19 vaccine program. It feels like we are too dependent on Keytruda and Gardasil9
With the spin off of Organon we have a great opportunity to be more innovative and agile, remove the bureaucracy and focus on our HH and AH products of now and in the future.
My Role and Future within MSD in not certain to me
How to bring more innovation to the patients
I'm focused on 'right now', the future isn't something I get excited about under any conditions other than a nice holiday someplace new.
Very exciting to work on new medicines for the world's benefit
What's next to Keytruda in the pipeline? What impact has RNA Technology for Ongology?  Is MSD prepared for this race of new technology?  Does MSD have enough joint ventures with small high tech R&D companies?
I'd like to understand more about the threats and opportunities with the m-RNA vaccines.
Good company and we will make it Asia number 1 company very soon
I am a little nervous with all of the leadership changes.
I am excited about the future, but I feel we need to look not only into the long-term but also think about short-term solutions as well.  I feel we get too focused on the big picture ideas and do not think about what is needed right now.  For instance, in livestock we are not in the medicated feed additive space.  This is a high-dollar, high-margin space that could be used to pull along the rest of our portfolio and block competitors.  We also have an opportunity to be leaders in parasiticides but fail to bring new products to market.
We botched the whole Covid pandemic and hopefully we do something equally important for the human race to make up for it
A little skeptical about the future with performance dragging due to COVID-19.
The company is split into MSD en Organon. We focus on vaccins. That is new technology en new workplaces
not sure what the new CEO & other senior leaders will do once Ken & Roger are officially gone? For example: Will Merck continue to invest in R&D? How strong will Dean Li be as a leader if our revenues come from Oncology & he's not an Oncologist or Immunologist? Lots of uncertainty
I'm concerned about the level of training technicians and managers are receiving. Over the past 5 or so years, training employees has taken a backseat to getting product out the door. New hires are leaving because they're being offered one shift by HR and then the department needs change and their shift is changed. New hires are leaving because training is not a priority and they are frustrated.
In the past year there have been many changes in the leadership at Merck (Corporate, US Marketing, US Sales, etc.).  Although the shifts and appointments have involved individuals with relevant qualifications and experience, I am far more uncertain than usual about the stability of the company due to both the number of individuals in new positions and the underwhelming diversity of those in that leadership grouping. The future of the company is only as stable and successful as leaderships ability to coordinate, cooperate , and stay informed on issues related to innovation with our product/solution pipeline, customer access, and employee satisfaction/wellbeing.
Yes, the future is bright for the company because of the amazing people that give incredible efforts and dedication every day to advance this company. However, I don't think it's possible to be fully excited about the amount of effort it takes to keep that excellence for the company and at the same time also be excited about the "life" part of work/life balance. After more than a decade of working here, I've decided it's either all-in on one or the other for me - I can't go half-way on either because I'll end up being mediocre at both. That's due to the standard of work that's been increasing more and more year after year in my particular area.
Company wide I agree, As a specific department I disagree.
Appreciate the regular updates from Senior Management
The speed to bring innovation to market worries me and our approach to different technologies (i.e. dismissing mRNA technology) to bet on more traditional platforms does not demonstrate openness and willingness to take necessary risks.
the quality of contract workers coming in are not what they used to be and they are getting  hired.  the work ethic and skills arer not there.
No clarity about future pipeline and new products in the CVM portfolio
One of the best animal health company which truly works for betterment on human and animals
Yes it give opportunities to grow in the organisation
Concerned about the political direction and political tone of the company.
Merck need to build stronger pipeline for future
so im not sure as to the strength of our pipeline and our site is hpv heavy
Merck leadership is empowering at all levels, and we can only continue to grow for the good of mankind.
With many Sr. Leadership changes, sagging sales and a lingering pandemic, I am less certain about Merck's future.  Thus, it is difficult to agree that I am excited about Merck's future.
We are becoming very focused in oncology.  Hopefully we stay committed to other areas as well (and also allocate resources to those areas as well!!). While oncology is huge for the company (understandably), it is also important to allocate adequate funds/resources to fully support the other therapeutic areas that we cover. Otherwise, we could be at a competitive disadvantage vs those companies that are really focused/investing in their assets (outside of oncology).
Coming out of the pandemic creates concern, including lagging sales, the removal of our Covid vaccines and the molnupiravir delay.
I understand  what I  have to do every day at my work.
Relevant marketing materials are slow in the launch phase of new indications and in keeping with customer needs to drive the business
I do have the resources to do my job well, but efficiency could be improved with more IT resources to help build more automated solutions (opposed to very manual work today).
Too much work in system from LT related to capacity available and change in system. When present back what is needed to achieve the work - limited support.
There are always new processes that need to be learned and one is not aware of it until there is a problem. That is very frustrating.
Many people working from home do not have enough hardware (second monitor, headset, working chair) to properly fulfill the daily work activities.
I feel extremely fortunate to work for a company that values it's employees. Glad that the company still supports remote working environment.
In my work area we need a constant influx  of educational resources to serve better our customers.
A laptop in addition to iPad seems necessary for several tasks.
I would argue that this department, while needing analytical support does little to maintain the analytical support that it has, let alone grow it.  sorry, but other functional groups seem to get all their itches scratched in terms of head count, but we have to scrounge for a lot of ours.
From a sales perspective, there always seems to be a gap between sales and marketing.  What the customer needs versus what we have in Rome and invest our resources in.  We have a vast amount of resources, but I question where they are the most relevant and needed resources for our customers/selling interactions.
Not enough support locally from functions such as legal, compliance, finances ... because their lack of resources. The procedures/process are heavy, unclear, always changing, people are lost.
Policy restrictions that prohibit either mention of product or disease category make sales appointment requests a hurdle. Slow approval time frame for new data and resources to the field.
We have a serious problem meeting patient needs with our specialty pharmacies and MAP programs.
We in HR are seriously understaffed. Although this has been raised multiple times, nothing changes.
Poor training
I used to think so, but all the additional barriers extend project timelines and demand for more people...so now I need more time and money for resource extensions...if we don't get it, at least we'll have really good documentation of a failed project.
Staffing and more importantly trained staff is in shortage.  Only able to focus on immediate issues and not build or develop for the future.
I will miss the opportunity to launch products and new indications/market events in live PDG and Lecture settings including offering wine and a 3-star restaurant. The physician and medical staff community value these, and it helps to launch new information.   Would love more leave behind resources to support 100% of our portfolio.
With so many schedule changes, machine issues, personnel issues, component issues it is a daily struggle, but I always do the best with what I can.
I feel very supported by the programs Merck has in place but it is not always supported by my direct manager.
During this COVID-19 environment, The powers to be at Merck have slowed progress with the COVID tracker. All other competitor companies are not only in the field, but conducting live MMFs. Our company takes too long to make decisions that could allow us to be in the field and conduct MMFs to support our brands. I don’t think the company is listening to us about what’s happening in the field.
The budget îs cut every year
Yes we are well equipped according to industry requirements.
The IT support is absolutely abysmal.  An example of what NOT to do.  Every interaction is 45 minutes.  Very very poor.  Not exactly "white glove service."
We do not have the human capital to support my division.  The team I work on is one person short and there is no plan to backfill.  The representatives who support us are leaving their position in droves and there are 3 levels of approval to fill their spots.  So my team who traditionally works with C and D Suite leadership is now being tasked to call on people who reps have called on.  There are not enough hours in the day to get all the work done.  And the biggest barrier - we spend 90% of our time in internal meetings.
In my role there are certain groups that support well and others that don't. Overall I can find what I need but it takes time and energy depending on what resource I am seeking.
as the scope of work has increased adding more species to our work I need more resources to do my job well
I have trouble accessing drawings/prints/engineering design changes/vendor engineering prints & documents. And even when i do find a print, there is no way to verify it is the correct revision.   It is difficult to access previous work orders in our CMMS to be able to trend equipment performance.
Live access to my customers is the resource I most need from Merck.
I feel there could be some improvements with field emails and more ROME resources for offices/patients to support our job expectation in the field.
The addition of virtual resources have been very helpful.
My Department is still living in the 70's, which makes my job harder and not ergonomically friendly!
With the spin off it's more and more difficult to do my best work due to the gaps that currently exist and juggling everything to make sure nothing drops.
Providers are extremely frustrated at the lack of managed care access I have for the products I’m promoting in my territory.
I've witnessed inconsistency in how technology is approved within the dept - it's very manager-based.  Some managers have directly told me to purchase the items I need which is sometimes not mirrored by my direct manager.  It would be helpful to get a list of items that can be covered as a way to universally baseline what is an acceptable spend.
I would like to have all the equipment I'd do if I were at the office instead of having to buy them all myself, like a proper chair, maybe a printer [or easily access to one], feet support etc... but I understand the difficult logistic involving sending this to everyone...
All the assets are given are good and very help in my daily work of company
I think the biggest challenge in regard to this question is knowing where to find the resources...
It would be great if we had more non-branded programs with general disease overview, various tumor types etc.  Also, t is challenging to navigate the partnership with AZ counterparts with the differing rules/regulations regarding programs.  Additional Merck owned resources for Lynparza in the WC space would be helpful in my role as a WC OSR.
Need more samples. Merck continuously only gives me 2-4 steglatro and steglujan and thus, I cannot give enough to providers. Belsomra as well
I'm too new in my current role at this time.
With the tight budget, it is hard to achieve on objectives.  I cannot deliver on new targets if the money isn't there to do scientific experiments.
Resources could be organized better (easier to find), but that is to be expected at a large company with so many different projects and resources.
In the age of technology, we need to make sure employees are equipped with speed (well equipped computer hardware) and ease of accessibility (for connecting devices like headphones, speakers, etc).  Clear instructions should be accessible for troubleshooting connecting devices to Merck computers.  After over a year of WFH, we still have issues trying to connect headphones, earbuds directly to Merck computers.
Our infrastructure is too reliant on manual processes for the era in which we are in.  To be market competitive moving forward, we need to reduce the number manual process steps.
I think we could open up our way of thinking in the past and present to compete better with how the veterinary industry is shifting-contracts, promote etc.
Our machines constantly have issues which delay our processes.
We should have the option to have a laptop to improve productivity.
In general I agree, however most above site initiatives I have seen have added extra resource needs and complexity - this needs to change if we are to be competitive in future
that we might be forced to report back to the office while we are still supporting homeschool for our children
Direction and a voice that will represent the team.
Other: work/life balance, layoff (of others) me getting their/additional workload
When questions are related to Manger, it is hard to answer because in MSD we do not have one manager, we have more than 1 managers, so it is confusing whether you will referrer to functional manager or Admin manager. If both managers have different attitude and working style , you may like one and may not like other, so when we take survey , don't know which manager we need to keep in mind.
Retirement is important to me.  So retirement planning is a high priority
Being visible to get the recognition, how I'm perceived by my peers, work life balance seems to suffer to 'prove' one self to a glass ceiling
Inability to experiment with technology /  Apps under IT constraints with any interaction with office 365. Taking rapid decisions based on a good rational
Family and older relatives wellbeing due to Covid. Also would like to see many of the remote working options available post covid particularly those that drive effienincy such as remote meetings and phone calls
I worry about my anxiety and metal stress from so much working at home, and so much admin and process. I feel like a data processor alot of the time and it is completely de-moralising.
Other:  Overall work life balance
The transformation from hierarchical decision making to empowering
Dont have sufficient resource for workload, leading to overtime and lack of work life balance
Isolation due to COVID restrictions
Western economies are stuck in a situation where corporations and their lobbying power have moved citizens to second place. e.g. Corporate tax paid in the US last year accounted 7% of tax revenue, down form 40% in 1980. This means that citizens earn less, work longer, both parents need to work, children do not get the homes they need to grow as healthy adults and we are caught in a spiral. The destruction of communities and imbalance of power between citizen, politics and Corporations is our greatest threat. Historically all 3 have flourished in a balanced society but now that balance is undone. This imbalance is at the core of Global Warming, Inequality and personal happiness.
I do not really feel concerned
lack of Work / Life balance - We need priorities that match our resources
Living conditions / Freedom of movement (being far from family)
Gun control issues combined with racial injustice are deeply concerning
The lack of clarity around work location requirements for the global organization creates stress. Although working remotely does not work for everyone, it can work very well for other and they would prefer to remain remote. It would help if the global organization could share the future requirements regarding work location, or let us know if location requirements will be a local decision based on role.
workload and ability to get everything done well
Work/Life balance
Return to the office
When we can return to the work site on a regular basis.
The pandemic has introduced quite a bit of change in how we work.  That along with new systems and attempts to improve processes, etc. has resulted in too much change.  We have a ton of resources and a ton of meetings.  We are told to look up a job aid or a Barnum FAQ to find answers.  It is great that we have all of these resources, however, I spend more time trying to find answers in the various teamspaces, community pages, central pages, SOPs, guidance documents, etc. and trying to figure how how to do my job correctly than I do being productive.  And it seems that just when you have the answers, it changes.  The stress and frustration levels are high.
To be able to have a balance between work and personal life.
Increased production at our facility without increasing capacity has strained nearly every individual on the shop floor.
Ability to work the way I should with our customers.  When vaccinated we should be able to go to work if accepted by customers.
There are a number of initiatives at Merck that appear to be driven by the political climate and the media rather than a true sense of social justice.  Employees are "strongly encouraged" to participate in activities that may not coincide with their personal views.  I have heard employees state that they feel intimidated to speak up and voice their opinion for fear they will be mis-labled and outcast.
My biggest challenge right now is managing/absorbing all the additional responsibility and workload that has come with Organon standup and Merck rebuild on top of COVID challenges and projects with then Fortify and EX25 priorities coming on top of that.  I am concerned that for me, my team, and colleagues across operations and functions that we interact with, all this sustained increased workload could overstress the organization and result in retention challenges and brand damage.
Coming changes to the organization that may impact group, leading to personal changes and/or create a lot of anxiety to staff that will require much active management
Managing the work overload that just continues to pile up. IT Transformation, Fortify, Spin-Off, budget savings, transformation to the cloud, full virtual working environment. it's just more and more on the plate never any less and it's unsustainable
work/life balance
When our CEO, Ken Frazier, spoke up on Charlottesville, George Floyd and the Capital Riots, I was incredibly proud and and fully aligned with the sentiment and facts of each situation.  However, when I saw the Georgia voting response from our company, I was not on board.  I see the Georgia situation  as highly political and not based on facts.  I felt I was looking at things objectively by believing that we need  two things.  One, to make voting accessible to every single person who wants to vote and two, to have a system/process that is secure. This seems reasonable to me.  And I felt this is what Georgia was attempting to do.  As a result of our company’s comments, I was not aligned with our company’s position. I believe we were contributing toward further racial division in our country and we were contributing toward a false narrative.  Many customers voiced their displeasure with that position to us as well.
I am in total support of Merck's Diversity and Inclusion engagement. I pride myself for having a sales team that is very diversified and inclusive. Though valuable,  D n I is taking up a lot of time and energy and I feel people are feeling that D n I is being a bit heavy handed. My people need development in many areas, not just in their understanding of Diversity and Inclusion.
I do NOT want to physically go back to work in the office again. Remote is so much better than commuting, public bathrooms, wearing adult clothing, drinking office coffee, packing a lunch or eating garbage cafeteria food, or sitting in overcrowded disease-ridden conference rooms (people are gross).
How do we smoothly transition from our mainly work from home model to back in the office a few days a week (or all week).  Knowing, that things have changed, schools and after school programs are not open as late and also expect you to be home with your kids in a day's notice.
Workload and unreasonable timeline expectations; for certain teams, the deadlines are constant. It is not possible to take any time off.
Ability to create separation between work and home life.
Politicization of Merck
managing the stress that comes with a complicated work/life balance
I would like reassurances that going forward after the pandemic that Merck will continue to support employees with unique family situations with the work environment they need to be successful at Merck and continue to care for their families. Remote working has been embraced and a balance of the current environment with a "back in the office" environment will ensure retention of top talent.
Having worked remotely for well over a year, I plan to continue to work this way moving forward.  Our group has embraced this working however still are a bit slim on details of what expenses/items will be allowed for remote workers.
I am most concerned that this is the list you think we are most concerned about.  I am concerned that we are getting over inflated financial budget expectations from the top down regardless of the market conditions we indicate, the soaring cost of goods, and the lack of new products in the pipeline, and the bureaucracy that slows it all down and inhibits adaptation.  I am concerned that this company is getting involved in news cycle issues like State level voting laws, State level political issues like transgender bathroom use, etc..  Leave that for the politicians, the news media, and the citizens of those states to deal with and lets focus on our core business without all of that peripheral distraction.  Business is business.
Work life balance
While I do understand the value in being back in the office work location and there will be protocols in place to keep us as safe as possible, returning to the workplace setting concerns me.
lack of management to address habitual absences resulting in forces in my workgroup
Career opportunities
I am most worried about my mental health as a result of continued work pressure and stress. I understand we need new ways of working, however we don't have enough resources in order to even brainstorm different ways of doing things. Burn out is very real.
Working for my Team, for Merck but most important for the patients.
We as a company need to focus on our mission and our financial goals. It is best to leave social events and politics out of the mix.
The the things i stated above, job security with so many reps, restriction from compliance, the RAT tool.
Base salaries for tenured employees remain capped
Concerned for the safety of the COVID vaccine and that Merck will require FBE to take this vaccine.
Child has undiagnosed health disorder.
Merck is an amazing company to work for.  I responded that I won't be working for Merck in the next two years because I am lucky enough to be able to retire later this year.
Work/life balance
Haven't seen family for more than a year and half since they are overseas. Look forward for an arrangement from MSD to support us, meeting our families.

I am very much worried about the safety of my family and a bit worried about of loosing job in lay off of field employee after Januvia LOI, if happens.
Timing and life balance. Workload & need to keep intouch all time.
Upper Management have been resistant in acknowledging our concerns in regard to work-life-balance.  We are a support function with a high volume job. The people we support have increase significantly every year, yet our support function has not. We are suffering health issues (mental and physical) due to the fact that we have a constant need to run faster and faster and to work several hours of overtime every day. The issue has been raised for the past 3 years without any acknowledgement from previous manager and upper management. Our new manager has been fighting our case since she took over our team one year ago and finally we have been granted a contractor to help out. We need a permanent solution. We need to be heard, when raising concerns about work-life-balance and we need to be able to work in accordance with our contract without a constant need to give extra hours of work on a daily basis.
taking the right decision where to work next
Finding a house as a First Time Buyer
I am concerned that although MSD speaks about work/life balance it is frowned upon to want to work part time or even 4 days a week using parental leave. This seems unafir and I believe that if it was possible to work a 4 day week there would be almost the same amount of work being done as you wouldcertainly be even more proactive knowing that you want to get the same amount of work completed as normal but within a shorter week and at the same time saving the company a day's wages. As a mother of an 18month old and currently pregnant again I would consider leaving a job which I both enjoy and am competant at all for the sake of one extra day with my children.
Housing / cost of living - future preparation for retirement/family
Achieving the right work/personal balance during the Covid lockdown.
Im worried when I might be called back to work from office. Frankly speaking I feel working from home permanetly will be the best case for me since - I'm comfortable,, I can balance my work/personal life better, my physical and mental health is better and feel I'm more productive, working from home.
You didn't ask anything about remote work- which is surprising considering that's a huge topic elsewhere.
My biggest concern is Merck's recent decision to weigh in and comment on social and political issues and events that are outside of the scope of what we do.   In particular, I found it  discouraging that the company made a public announcement regarding a recent law enacted by another state regarding its decision to change its laws.   All states have the right to change their  laws which they have jurisdiction over,  and for our company to criticize such laws, and suggest that the changes result in a negative impact to a particular segment of our population is completely inappropriate.  In addition, I am a bit confused about whether the views of the senior leadership, and in particular the CEO are supposed to reflect the general views of Merck's employees?  If that is the case, as a minority and proud American, I do not feel that I was given the opportunity for my voice to be heard.
Being Valued for the hard work and consistent effort put in every day to help the company succeed.
The well-being of employees is very dependent on the culture and management of a department. And the company therefore consists of many small "companies" within the bigger company. Although the policy and initiatives of MSD are good (breaking down silos, empowerment of people, inclusion of people, etc.) this is visible in some departments, but not in all.
Climate change!
Being healthy has to do with the amount of work and being able to have balance.   As we start to move to seeing customers the work load from our computer and workload that can't be accomplished on the road.   The vast majority of clinics is still shut down to curbside.   Spring is ultimately a busy time at MAH....but maybe reserving other product promotions until after Spring - too many programs, CE, clinic requirements/requests being fired off and expected all at the same time.....difficult to prioritize and manage.....clinics are still just trying to survive one day at a time.

the ability of our leadership to recognize issues that our company has before it and tackle them.   the culture among our building.
Lot of experimenting.  Need to move experiment results into standard work.
Career progression

Improved technology and utilization of systems and not excel spreadsheets. Need to leverage best practices and implement once vetted out.

work - life balance
career path and professional development
I have been asked to do way more than I can handle. As others in my position have been. Some is do to someone leaving, but the over response to Covid has greatly complicated many aspects of my job making many tasks much more complicated.
My professional development at the company. Quality and balance of personal life.
When I say work resources, I mean things like sufficient legal support for animal health, a plan for deployment of vaccination equipment (structured, centralized approach to provide this equipment to customers + a plan for maintaining this equipment) and sufficient headcount in our commercial support services functions to allow dossiers to move ahead at a reasonable pace.   The staying healthy part is related to recent personal health concerns.   The Politics component is that I do have concerns about how politicized the pandemic and certain social issues have become and I have concerns for the preservation of individual freedoms moving forward.
Communication across the company isnt great just now ... its is often slow, only uses on channel of communication and doesnt treat internal changes / communication as well as external customers.  Esp for things like compliance updates. Great that we have the compliance champs and they do and outstanding job but central coms to everyone, use of teams compliance site / yammer etc should also be used as to not miss anyone. I feel like you can never over communicate in MSD... that saying tell them... tell them again is SOOOOOO imporant internally as well as externally.   Also i think we are still so far behind in material generation across the company and digital and still too much red tape Vs what other companies are able to do and this. We still have a big issue with medical signitories and not having enough... that items in development take weeks and weeks to get through which then makes new content no longer new or relevant.
Merck is not positioned well for the future and has become so distracted with peripheral issues that it has lost its focus on the job at hand.
This is my first job that requires electronic BR's, validation execution activities, and log books. I've gone through NEO however there was no training for this type activity. Most of my co-workers are computer savvy, I am not.
work-life balance
Politics and especially its influence on vaccine hesitancy, opening too early, and dropping protective measures (masks, social distance) too quickly.  Not to mention global warming, increasingly limited water supply in most of the world.
managing in a remote work environment efficiently including addressing team member's needs (overall managerial tools)
Too much work is expected of me without enough support!
Not staying up to date with technologies in the software community. Merck can feel boring to work at because it's practices feel archaic.
Sexual orientation.
mental health
Concerned with how Merck plans to role back out after the pandemic is over. There will be an adjustment period after the WFH policy has finished. In addition, concerns around work/life balance. Since WFH was rolled out, there has been a flux of people that are constantly working or one's that are taking advantage of the working from home. This has added much pressure to those that are working round the clock.
I have no concerns at this moment. I am working safely from home and I have been provided with all the work resources needed to do my job. Thank you!
I'm concerned about health freedom. I hope people will continue to have a choice to vaccinate or not vaccinate.  I don't want to see vaccine passports being implemented, because that will take away people's freedoms and the tech companies will collect our personal data.
